<h1>Regulations and Procedures<a class="headerlink" href="#regulations-and-procedures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section covers specific policies of the Computer Science Department and
makes reference to some of the most important governing  policies and procedure
of the Graduate School, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml">http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml</a>,
but this Computer Science Handbook <em>does not attempt to duplicate the statement
of all Graduate School policies</em>.</p>
<p id="index-0"><strong>The Graduate School takes deadlines very seriously.</strong>  All Graduate School
key academic and administrative deadlines and starting dates are listed at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/key_dates.shtml">http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/key_dates.shtml</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="course-loads">
<span id="index-1"></span><h2>Course Loads<a class="headerlink" href="#course-loads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A full-time student will usually carry three courses in fall and spring
semesters. Students can also choose to be part-time. This is an <em>academic</em>
policy.  Be sure to see if you have separate constraints due to a loan program for domestic students
or due to federal visa policy for
international students.</p>
<p>We do not encourage students to take more than 3 courses a term, and you should
contact the Graduate Program Director if you need to take more than 3 courses
in a term for any reason. It is explicitly prohibited to enroll in more than 3
courses to hold a space in a course. Many of our courses fill up quickly, so
you should only register for courses that you truly plan to complete.  No one
is allowed to take more than 12 credit hours in Fall or Spring.</p>
<p>This means most students finish the program in 16 months: Three fall/spring
semesters for 9 of the courses, and the intervening summer for one course.
Some students take an extra summer course, leaving a reduced load for the last
semester, when it may be particularly convenient to devote time to a job or job
search.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="registration">
<span id="index-2"></span><h2>Registration<a class="headerlink" href="#registration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Both new and continuing students must complete the process of registration
before every semester in which they are either enrolling in classes. Also there
is a special course conferring full-time registration for
MS Computer Science students opting to complete a
thesis and who are only writing a thesis that semester.
For details on choosing courses see <a class="reference internal" href="#course-selection"><span class="std std-ref">Course Selection</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="#advising"><span class="std std-ref">Advising</span></a> below.</p>
<p><em>Students must maintain continual registration throughout their years</em> in the
program unless they explicitly apply for and are approved for a
<a class="reference internal" href="#leave-of-absence"><span class="std std-ref">Leave of Absence</span></a>.  You must also announce your decision to come back
from a Leave of Absence with an email to the Associate Dean of the Graduate
School.  Only after the Graduate School accepts your letter announcing your
plan to return, will you be allowed to register for classes.  Forgetting this
can cause lots of hassle and delay in registration for the semester when
you do wish to resume.</p>
<p>After registration opens you can register yourself through LOCUS for most
courses with just your student ID number.</p>
<p><em>New students should get course advising first from the department</em>, and all
others are welcomed to get advising from their advisor listed in Locus.</p>
<p id="index-3"><em>You cannot register yourself for Comp 490 or 499</em> as both require permission
of the GPD or instructor of record. See sections <a class="reference internal" href="#independent-study"><span class="std std-ref">Independent Study</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="#internships"><span class="std std-ref">Internships (COMP 499)</span></a>.</p>
<p>In any course where there is a note about <em>consent or permission required</em>, you
must make a direct emailed request to the department, <em>clearly stating</em> the
course and <em>section</em> (if more than one is offered) and <em>semester</em>, and number
of <em>credits</em> if that is variable. If you are asking for a course that requires
permission of the instructor, please add your direct request to an approving
email that you forward from the instructor.  The department then gives consent
and <em>does your registration administratively</em>.  Within a few days you should
confirm in Locus that your request was correctly entered.</p>
<p id="index-4">It is in your best interest to register early, to get into sections you want.
Registration blocks can get in your way.
Common examples are an immunization block, a Dean of Students data block,
a conditional admission block, or a bursar block.
Students have been given late fees or had
a lot of trouble due to delay from such blocks.  One misleading feature in
LOCUS is that all MS students have a Dean’s time limit block, but it does not
activate until you have been an MS student for five years - do not worry about
that one.</p>
<p><em>You are strongly encouraged to check in Locus weeks before
registration opens,</em> <em>to see if a block appears</em>, and get it addressed so it
will not delay your registration.</p>
<p>In Locus you can see the kind of block that is present by clicking on the red blocked symbol
(a slash mark through a circle).  Do check.</p>
<p><em>The only block that the GPD has power to address is a probation block</em>, and
that requires you to contact the GPD and have a talk.
Asking for department help for other blocks
is only going to waste everyone’s time.  Instead deal with the office that
added and controls the block:
wellness center, Dean of Students, GPEM, bursar….</p>
<p>Blocks can also suddenly appear later, so check again a few days before
registration opens.  Also, you may want to swap courses while it is still
allowed in the first week of classes.  Shortly before classes start, also
check for a block.</p>

<div class="section" id="course-selection">
<span id="index-5"></span><span id="id1"></span><h2>Course Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#course-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Even before you get access to our registration system, you can still look for
courses you are interested in.</p>
<p>Some time before registration opens there should be a link under
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/cs/schedules/">http://www.luc.edu/cs/schedules/</a> labeled with the name of the upcoming semester
with a detailed list of courses to be offered.</p>
<p>Before that, or looking further ahead, you can look at the long-term schedule,
showing what courses are planned for what semesters:
<a class="reference external" href="https://academics.cs.luc.edu/schedules/longtermschedule.html">https://academics.cs.luc.edu/schedules/longtermschedule.html</a>.  This is particularly
useful if you find too many courses that interest you for a given semester:
look at the long-term schedule to see which of those courses you could defer
until it is offered again.</p>
<p>Detailed descriptions of most of these courses are in
<a class="reference external" href="https://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/graduate-courses.html">https://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/graduate-courses.html</a>.</p>
<p>Comp 271 is the prerequisite for most graduate courses, but Comp 413,
Intermediate Object-Oriented Programming, is a prerequisite for the most
advanced software courses.  Many students, with even a strong undergraduate
computer science background, have not had the subject matter described in
<a class="reference external" href="https://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/comp413.html">https://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/comp413.html</a>.  If you are in either the MS in SE
or CS program, and have not had much of this material, it is a good course to
<em>start</em> with (offered every fall and spring, and likely summer),
since it is required of both
programs, and you want to be able to later get into the courses that have it as
a prerequisite.  IT students who want to mix in more software-centric electives
should also consider Comp 413.</p>
<p>Note, SE and CS students with prior experience with the Comp 413 material can
replace the Comp 413 course requirement: after consulting with your advisor,
substitute one of the courses which has Comp 413 as a prerequisite.</p>
<p><strong>Caution to Computer Science program students</strong>:  Comp 460 is required, and it is not
offered every semester:  You may not be able to defer it!  Make sure you have
arranged a place in your plans that fit with the semesters that it is offered
and <em>following</em> your prerequisite preparation in algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advising">
<span id="index-6"></span><span id="id2"></span><h2>Advising<a class="headerlink" href="#advising" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Newly admitted students should first consult with the Graduate Program Director
before registering for courses. A discussion with the GPD is particularly
important if there is any question of a student’s prerequisite preparation.</p>
<p>Before the <em>next</em> registration period, you should be provided an individual
faculty advisor for the rest of your studies.  This advisor should be listed in Locus.
Later registration choices
should be taken up with your advisor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="online-courses">
<span id="index-7"></span><span id="id3"></span><h2>Online Courses<a class="headerlink" href="#online-courses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While the majority of our courses are face to face in regularly scheduled class
sessions (likely with <em>some</em> online interaction), other courses can be done
<em>totally</em> online.  The learning objectives and outcomes of online courses are
the same as for face-to-face classes, but obviously with a somewhat different
delivery.</p>
<p>There are many models that an instructor can choose for online:  Parts can
include recorded video presentations, synchronous whole-class sessions,
synchronous small-group sessions, 1-1 with instructor online, threaded
discussions, wiki contributions, totally asynchronous involvement as long as
you are active each day, ….</p>
<p>There should be notes in the course list beside an online course.  Unfortunately
if you look directly in Locus, you do not see it with the course title,
but need to click on the section link.  If you want
more details about the format, contact the instructor.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://academics.cs.luc.edu/schedules/longtermschedule.html">long-term schedule</a>
includes an indication
of what courses to expect to be online.</p>
<p>At least part-time completion of an online MS IT degree is possible,
though it will restrict elective options,
and only some tracks can be completed full-time.</p>
<p>If you are only taking courses online, you would do well to
be in the program with code
ITEO-MS (IT Entirely Online).  This will give you an advantage in signing up
for online courses before other students.</p>
<p id="index-8"><strong>F-1 visa students</strong>:  Note that in the semesters that you are supposed to be
full-time, you may have only one online course, and at least one course must
not be online.  If you are not required to be in school in a semester
(commonly summer), there are no restrictions.  Please confer with the Office
of International Programs for details and confirmation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="independent-study">
<span id="index-9"></span><span id="id4"></span><h2>Independent Study<a class="headerlink" href="#independent-study" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you are doing an independent project for Comp 490, you need to find a
faculty member to supervise your project and have the faculty supervisor email
the department secretary to register you. This does not generally make sense in
your first semester but is possible in exceptional circumstances.  It helps if
you and the faculty member are familiar with each other.  Talk to your
instructors outside of class, and take advantage of community seminars and
events to meet and get to know faculty!  It is particularly helpful when you
want to do something that the professor already wants done.  At the other end
of the spectrum, a student might just propose something that sounds interesting
to a potential faculty supervisor who knows the student is self-motivated.  Or
a project could end up somewhere in between: something the professor is
interested in, with a particular twist that appeals to the student….</p>
<p>The typical approach is for the student to meet with the faculty member and
then confirm the details of the agreement in an email to the faculty
supervisor, being sure to include the exact <em>semester and credit hours</em> that
your have agreed on. The supervisor then forwards the email with his or her
approval to the <em>graduate secretary</em>, so she can register you. Your agreement
does <em>not</em> go to the GPD, unless you will end up with a total of more credits
of 490+499 than the normal 6 credit limit.</p>
<p>These courses are for 1-6 credits. See the section below on variable hour
courses. We rarely allow students to take more than 6 total credits in their
overall program for the sum of Independent Study and Internships, but do allow
further high-level independent study in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>In most cases, we recommend that you and your independent study advisor fill
out a <em>request for course title form</em>, which is available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Request%20for%20Course%20Title.pdf">http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Request%20for%20Course%20Title.pdf</a>
The Graduate Program Director must sign this form.  This is very useful when
someone else is reading your transcript: Plain “Independent Study” on your
transcript is totally uninformative!</p>

<span id="internships"></span><span id="index-10"></span><h2>Internships (COMP 499)<a class="headerlink" href="#internships-comp-499" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, you need to find a job for the period of the Internship.  There are
online, searchable listings through the university career center,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/career">http://www.luc.edu/career</a>. (The Computer Science
department also maintains an <em>informal</em> jobs list at <a class="reference external" href="http://jobs.cs.luc.edu">http://jobs.cs.luc.edu</a>.)
When you find a job, contact the GPD and get your job description approved.
Internships are for 1-6 credits.  See
<a class="reference internal" href="#variable-credit-courses"><span class="std std-ref">Variable Credit Courses</span></a>.</p>
<p>Download the <a class="reference external" href="https://loyolauniversitychicago-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/aharrin_luc_edu/EdjL1xCxOX5OtIZvwQClTkkB8ZNMWlRfvNvTuhvRIzMdww?e=BPivMt">MOU Form</a>,
<em>read it</em>, print, fill out <em>both pages</em>, and return.  Please read this carefully
before asking questions of the GPD.  It contains a description of the details
of your academic requirements for the course.  You will also need your job
supervisor’s signature.  Get the finished form to the GPD, so we can register
you for the course for the proper
number of credits.  Please do not ask us to register you if you are not
simultaneously submitting the completed MoU.</p>
<p>The form can be scanned and emailed or turn in paper to the department staff.
If you are doing <a class="reference internal" href="#cpt"><span class="std std-ref">Curricular Practical Training (For F-1 students)</span></a>, turn in the CPT form at the same time.</p>
<p>There are three related but different terms: <strong>job</strong>, <strong>internship</strong>, and
<strong>CPT</strong>, <a class="reference internal" href="#cpt"><span class="std std-ref">Curricular Practical Training (For F-1 students)</span></a>. You can have a job and not have it be an internship for
academic credit, or you can have a job that goes on longer than an academic
internship. Also if you are doing an academic internship, your job employer
does not need to classify your position as “internship”. If you are doing an
academic internship, the <a class="reference external" href="https://loyolauniversitychicago-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/aharrin_luc_edu/EdjL1xCxOX5OtIZvwQClTkkB8ZNMWlRfvNvTuhvRIzMdww?e=BPivMt">MOU</a>
indicates only two small requirements for your employer during your time in the
academic internship: The bulk of your duties must be related to doing computer
science in the real world, and the supervisor will write a few line email at
the end of the time of the academic internship indicating your successful
completion of all the hours required for the academic internship.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="curricular-practical-training-for-f-1-students">
<span id="cpt"></span><span id="index-11"></span><h2>Curricular Practical Training (For F-1 students)<a class="headerlink" href="#curricular-practical-training-for-f-1-students" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You should consult with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/oip">Office for International Programs(OIP)</a> for the full legal details of CPT.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the important points.  If you get a job on campus, like the
considerable number of students who have worked for Loyola’s Information
Services, you do not need to be doing CPT and no CPT restrictions apply.  If
you want to work off campus for pay, then you need to be doing CPT, and there
are a number of requirements.</p>
<p>First of all, you need to have been a full-time F-1 student anywhere in the
United States for two semesters.  Optionally, this could include
<a class="reference internal" href="#summer-full-time"><span class="std std-ref">F-1 Summer Full-time Status</span></a>.</p>
<p>To start CPT you must get an application submitted in one of two routes. In
both cases with the CPT application you should provide a written job offer
(which can be an email) from the prospective employer. The completed CPT
application must be delivered to the International Office, and they will issue
the work permit. The form to start CPT can be found <a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/iss/forms.shtml">here</a>.</p>
<p>The CPT can be tied to an academic course in either of two ways. You get a GPD
signature on the CPT application differently in the two cases.
<em>Be sure to completely fill out the form except for the GPD signature and date</em>
<em>before looking for a signature!</em>
Do not leave the GPD to guess which of the two options you
want:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can take the Comp 499 course specifically for <a class="reference internal" href="#internships"><span class="std std-ref">Internships (COMP 499)</span></a>,
with the regular tuition charge per credit.  Get the form with
your MOU and job offer to the GPD, and the
GPD will get the application
completed and forwarded to the OIP with the job offer.</li>
<li>For no extra
tuition you can generally tie it to a course you are
already planning to take. There is a section of the CPT application for this.
You can pair the
internship with a course in the same semester, <em>or pair a fall course</em>
and an internship in the <em>previous summer</em>.
If you do the no-extra-tuition option,
you are able to work but you <em>get no further credit toward graduation</em>.
<em>You may need to send the CPT form and job offer to the OIP yourself.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Students generally scan and email the CPT form to the GPD,
making sure the option chosen above is clearly indicated.</p>

For them, summer courses are optional.  (In the semester that you finish up,
you are automatically full-time, even if you have only 1-2 courses left, though
the GPD does need to confirm with the OIP when your 1-2 courses allow you to
finish.)</p>
<p>F-1 students starting in summer do need to be classified as full-time.  Also
students who start in spring may find it convenient to be full-time in summer
to allow <a class="reference internal" href="#cpt"><span class="std std-ref">Curricular Practical Training (For F-1 students)</span></a> to start a semester earlier than otherwise.</p>
<p>To have summer count automatically as full time for an F-1 student, you can
take 9 credits in total among all the different summer sessions.  This is
hard to do for two reasons: It is a lot of work to cram 3 courses into 12
weeks, and we offer a limited number of courses in summer, so it may be hard to
fit your interests with 3 courses.  These restrictions allow for a possible
opening: With permission from the GPD and OIP, you can get a waiver so you
are allowed to take fewer courses (generally 2)
and still be counted as full-time.
You can ask the GPD to approve this reduction in summer
because of the issues listed above.</p>
<p>Be sure to check with the OIP for the exact current details and correct forms
to ask the GPD to sign.</p>

<p>Comp 490 and 499 are for 1-6 credits. Up to 6 credits total can be counted
toward graduation, counting all the times you register for these two courses.
(In practice that usually means 3 or 6 credits since all other courses are 3
credits.) You do not need to take a multiple of three credits at a time. What
matters is the total, when it is time to graduate.</p>

<p>Our students can sometimes get into GSB courses.
They broaden the Computer Science offerings and let you take GSB
courses at the Graduate School’s much lower tuition rate.</p>
<p>Unless a GSB course has specifically been mentioned as being allowed to count toward
our department’s MS degrees, but sure to check first with the GPD.</p>
<p>There are a number
of special considerations coming from the fact that GSB courses are <em>quarter</em>
courses.  They have the same holidays as in The Graduate School semester
system, but exam times or term start times or both are different.
Because of the different term starting times, and the fact that GSB
students have priority in their school’s courses, it is usually
only practical to consider fall and summer GSB courses, when the term starts
are close.  Our students generally need to wait until shortly beofre the
term starts to be admitted to a GSB course with space in it.  This means our
students generally need a backup plan.</p>
<p>You cannot register yourself in any case:  be sure to make a direct request to the
GPD, close to the time the course starts, to see if there is space, and the GPD will
arrange your registration through the GSB:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Include a direct request like “Please register me for INFS 496
Section 001.” <em>not</em> an indirect question like “Would
it be OK if I register for….?”</li>
<li>Include your full name and Student ID number.</li>
<li>Explicitly acknowledge the GSB’s different drop deadlines.</li>
<li>It is also possible to request a swap for an alternate comflicting Comp course.</li>
</ol>
<p>The time of dropping the course is crucial in determining its effect.  Be aware
of the GSB deadlines for getting the course dropped with no trace and the later
deadline for avoiding  tuition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graduation">
<span id="index-15"></span><h2>Graduation<a class="headerlink" href="#graduation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Degrees are conferred in May, August, and December.  You must apply for
graduation <strong>way in advance</strong> of graduation or the official conferral of your
degree will be <strong>postponed</strong>. The GPD will not be able to appeal this for you.
Note that there are only graduation <em>ceremonies</em> in May.</p>
<p><strong>Deadlines</strong>: December 1 for Spring, February 1 for Summer graduation, August
1 for Fall graduation.  See the discussion of ceremonies below if you want to
participate in a graduation ceremony and you graduate in Summer or Fall.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong>: Go into Locus and submit your application for graduation <em>by the
deadline</em>.  That is all you need to do if you are on time.  There is no penalty
for guessing early about when you will graduate, but you will need to apply
again for the actual time.</p>
<p>You can apply  up to 15 days later, <em>with a penalty fee</em> and <em>walking a piece
of paper around</em>:  see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/LATE%20Application%20to%20Receive%20a%20Degree.pdf">http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/LATE%20Application%20to%20Receive%20a%20Degree.pdf</a>
In case the URL changes, it should be listed on the Graduate School Forms page
under Late Application for Graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Graduation Ceremonies are only in May</strong>:  If you have only <em>one</em> course left
for summer, you can ask to participate in the <em>previous</em> May graduation.  This
one course can be 490/499 for more than 3 credits.  To do this you must apply
for summer graduation by the deadline listed above and promptly email the GPD,
asking for approval to walk in the May ceremony.  If you graduate in the Summer
or Fall, you can choose to return to participate in the <em>following</em> May
graduation ceremony (unless you already participated in the previous May
graduation, as discussed above).</p>

<span id="index-16"></span><span id="id6"></span><h2>Leave of Absence<a class="headerlink" href="#leave-of-absence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you start graduate school, the default assumption is that you will be
enrolled each fall and spring until you sign up for graduation and graduate. If
you need to interrupt your studies before that, the Graduate School requires
that you apply for a leave of absence through the gsps system, under student
forms in <a class="reference external" href="https://gsps.luc.edu/">https://gsps.luc.edu/</a>.</p>
<p>After being approved for a leave, you will need to notify the Associate Dean of
the Graduate School of your intent to enroll before you can register for
classes and resume study. See the address under <a class="reference internal" href="general.html#graduate-school-offices"><span class="std std-ref">Graduate School Offices</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you <em>neglect to request a Leave</em>, the return process is longer and less
sure:  You need to fill out the <strong>Reinstatement</strong> form,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Reinstatement%20Request.pdf">http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Reinstatement%20Request.pdf</a>,
and return it to the GPD (preferably as an emailed electronic scan).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Besides the reinstatement form itself being filled out you need to
return a document with two other parts:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>The reason for your absence.  (The form says reason for reinstatement -
but it means reason for <em>absence</em>.)</li>
<li>Timeline to graduation:  When you plan to be back and when you plan

<p>You should always be able to withdraw yourself from the course in LOCUS, no
matter how you got registered for a course: by yourself in LOCUS, by a request
to the department staff, or off of a waiting list. If you are sure you want to
withdraw from a course, do not waste time emailing the department for help,
just do it yourself. The date that the withdrawal is entered into LOCUS affects
whether you get a W on your transcript, and whether tuition is still due.
Different dates apply.  Be sure to look at the Academic Calendar for the given
semester. Once you are registered, merely not attending class does <strong>NOT</strong>
extend these dates.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Withdrawal with no trace: Generally by the end of the first week of
full Fall and Spring semesters. Generally only through the first Tuesday
of the semester for Summer session.</li>
<li>Withdrawal with only a W on the transcript, and no tuition due:
Generally during the second week of Fall and Spring semesters.
Sometime during the first week in summer sessions. Be sure to check
the Academic Calendar at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/academics/schedules/">http://www.luc.edu/academics/schedules/</a>.
A W has no academic consequences.  It is just
a historical record of you changing your mind.</li>
<li>Withdrawal later during classes: W on the transcript and a partial
or complete tuition penalty. Do not get yourself into this situation
just by not paying attention!</li>

<p>The GPD must initiate an approval of course transfer after the first month of
classes but also before the end of your <em>first</em> semester.
<em>Email the GPD as a reminder</em>, after the first month of classes
and after we also have your transcript (and course by course evaluation for
international credits - see <a class="reference internal" href="#international-transfer"><span class="std std-ref">Further International Transcript Credit Transfer Requirements</span></a>).  Do not delay!
Your official transcripts need to show B or better in relevant courses.  For
conditionally admitted students, Loyola must already have the relevant official
transcript.</p>
<p>Although official transcripts are needed to
forward the request to the Grad School for final approval, you are welcomed to
show unofficial transcripts to the GPD to see if you have appropriate courses
(but still send a reminder when the official documents are in).</p>
<p>Note:  All courses, including graduate courses in your first 4 years since the
start of college, are considered part of your undergraduate education.  Only if
you do MS work <em>past</em> the four years of academic work can transfer credit be
considered.</p>

<p>Graduate students in the Computer Science Department are expected to maintain
an average of not less than B (3.0) during their course of study.  Those who
fail to meet this requirement may be dismissed by the Graduate School.  No more
than two grades of C or C+ can be counted toward the degree (while further
such grades do drag down the GPA).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="incomplete-grade">
<span id="index-22"></span><h2>Incomplete Grade<a class="headerlink" href="#incomplete-grade" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Faculty may assign the grade of I to a student who has not completed the
assigned work by the end of the term for some good reason.  This grade is <em>not</em>
assigned automatically.  It is up to the student to explain the circumstances
and work out a plan with the instructor before the end of the course,
including a deadline, for completing
the work for the course.</p>
<p>Under the Graduate School regulations, a student has one semester to complete
the course (and summer counts as a semester!).  If the student does not turn in
the work by the deadline, the I grade will automatically become an F.  Please
read the new policy on the Graduate School web page at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml#grades1">http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml#grades1</a>.</p>
<p>Although it is not uncommon for graduate students to take an occasional
Incomplete, it is of course better not to take an incomplete when possible.
Making up an incomplete course often proves harder than students expect,
particularly if much time has elapsed since the end of the course.  In any
case, faculty members have various policies regarding Incompletes, so it is
advisable to discuss the matter with your instructor as early as possible if
you anticipate the need for an Incomplete.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="academic-honesty">
<span id="index-23"></span><h2>Academic Honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although academic dishonesty can take many forms, in our field it manifests
primarily as plagiarism of text or source code.  The Graduate School Catalog
defines plagiarism as “the appropriation for gain of ideas, language or work of
another without sufficient public acknowledgment that the material is not
one’s own.”  As a graduate student, you very likely have a good understanding
of the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not.  If you are ever
uncertain, it is of course best to consult your instructor,
the GPD or another faculty member.</p>
<p>The penalty for an instance of plagiarism is, at a minimum, failure on the
assignment, which may well be tantamount to failure in the course.  A serious
breach or a pattern of dishonesty can lead to expulsion from Loyola.  Although
quite rare in our department, cases have occurred in the past and have resulted
in dismissal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grievance-procedure">
<span id="index-24"></span><h2>Grievance Procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#grievance-procedure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Students, faculty, and administrators are strongly encouraged to resolve any
problems they encounter in the academic process through informal discussion.
If you are unable to resolve a problem with a member of the staff or faculty,
or if you wish to lodge a formal complaint, you should first meet to discuss
the matter with the GPD. If the problem cannot be satisfactorily resolved by
the GPD, it will be taken up by the Department Chair.  Unfortunately
fully addressing a grievance within the department can take considerable time.
The student must be patient.
If a student is not satisfied with the decision within the department, then
<em>after</em> the departmental decision, not earlier, the student may wish to
initiate a grievance in writing to the Dean.  Further information
can be obtained from the Graduate School office.</p>
