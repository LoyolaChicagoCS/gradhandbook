.. index:: ID cards

Student ID Cards
--------------------------------------

After registering for classes, Student ID cards, which give access to library borrowing and other privileges, 
are available from Corboy Law Center, 25E. Pearson or the Campus Card Office, Sullivan Center, Room 117.
See http://www.luc.edu/campuscard/ for more information.

.. index:: computer services

Computer Services
--------------------------------------

The University maintains several Computer Centers which are available 
for your use in Sullivan Center, Information Commons, and at 25 E. Pearson.

All university students are responsible for reading and following 
http://www.luc.edu/its/policies/policy_access_use.shtml. 

An account on the student email system is created automatically for each new student. 
Both the GPD and the Graduate School will use this account 
to communicate with you. It is therefore crucial that you check your Loyola e-mailbox 
on a regular basis. Having your e-mail forwarded to another account can be risky. 
Some students find the mail doesn't always get delivered. 
If you find that you are not receiving regular and frequent communiqués from the 
Department, please notify the Secretary.

Students are encouraged to consult the Systems Handbook for more information about 
departmental and university computing resources. See http://syshandbook.cs.luc.edu/.

The Emerging Technologies Laboratory
--------------------------------------

All graduate students in the BS and MS programs have access to a common space 
in the Water Tower Campus, Lewis Towers 409, 
also known as the Emerging Technologies Laboratory. Access is via the Loyola campus card.

Please contact the Department Secretary or Computer Systems Manager for access, 
if you have trouble entering with your Loyola campus card.

.. index:: summer sessions

Summer Sessions
--------------------------------------

Summer sessions are offered through the Department each year, 
running from May to August. There are two 6-week sessions and an 
overlapping 8-week session.  Two to four graduate-level courses are generally 
offered over these summer terms.

We encourage research-minded students to consider 
independent study with a department faculty member.

Internships can also be arranged for summer.

.. index:: housing
   apartments
   
Housing
--------------------------------------

Most graduate students choose to find their own off-campus apartments 
using the ads in the Reader, the Tribune, and other publicly available sources. 
Loyola’s Department of Residence Life also offers single- and double-occupancy 
apartments for graduate students on the Lakeshore Campus and the Water Tower Campus. 
For additional information, please see http://www.luc.edu/reslife or the links in
http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/gradstudcmty.shtml.

.. index:: transportation

Transportation
--------------------------------------

Parking is available near the Water Tower Campus, although it is rather expensive. 
You can have your parking stub stamped at the information desk 
at the 25 E. Pearson building to receive a modest discount. 
As a current student, you will also want to acquaint yourself with the 
University’s inter-campus shuttle bus service. 
Public buses and the “El” run frequently between campuses and to other 
points in the city.

There is also parking available near the Lake Shore Campus.
The main parking structure, adjacent to Sheridan Road and to the Halas Sports Center, 
houses the Parking Office, where you may purchase a sticker for annual parking. 
The fee for one-day parking on campus is $7.00. 
At peak class times, available parking can sometimes be scarce. 
Street parking in the community immediately surrounding campus is scarce. 
It is also restricted to residents during certain hours, 
so be sure to read the signs carefully to avoid being ticketed by the police.

Further information on parking is available at http://www.luc.edu/parking/.
For information on the shuttle, see http://www.luc.edu/transportation/shuttlebus.shtml.

.. index:: publication

Publication
--------------------------------------

Research-oriented graduate students (especially those pursuing the :ref:`thesis_option` 
in MS CS) are encouraged to pursue the publication of one or more journal articles 
during their graduate career. In the current job market, publication is an 
important means of demonstrating to prospective employers a high level of motivation 
and professional competence. 
It can also be helpful for your future pursuits as a doctoral student elsewhere.

Ways to prepare for this goal are 1) to read journals in your fields of interest 
regularly in order to become familiar with both current scholarship 
and the requirements of scholarly publication; 
2) to approach seminar papers, especially those in your field(s) of interest, 
as potential publications, possibly even as publications targeted to a particular journal. 
In developing a paper for publication, students are of course well advised to work 
closely with their seminar instructors or faculty mentors. 

.. index:: conference presentations
   travel funding
   
Conference Presentations and Travel Funding
-----------------------------------------------

Presentation of conference papers is an important part of students’ professional 
development, and MS CS students working on a thesis in particular should aim to give at 
least two papers during their graduate careers—preferably including professional 
and not just graduate-student conferences.

Each semester the Graduate School has funds to support graduate student 
travel for the purpose of presenting papers or chairing sessions at conferences. 
Since funds are limited, students should apply immediately upon acceptance of their 
papers or sessions. 
(Forms are available at http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/servicesandresources_forms.shtml).

.. index:: Career Center

Career Center
--------------------------------------

The University’s Career Center, where each student entering the job market 
should establish a dossier containing letters of recommendation, 
is located in Sullivan Center, Room 295 (773-508-7716), 
with a very helpful website: http://www.luc.edu/career/RamberLink_Login.html

Students are encouraged to check our information jobs listings as well at 
http://jobs.cs.luc.edu. We are routinely contacted by employers who are 
seeking interns, consultants, and "permanent" employees.

.. index:: teaching opportunities

Teaching Opportunities
--------------------------------------

In addition to occasional teaching assignments for Graduate Assistants 
(e.g. to help their instructor when he/she needs to be absent), 
a number of teaching opportunities are available to experienced graduate students 
and graduates who have gained experience since leaving our department 
(with a preference for the latter). The University requires that you have the MS degree; 
the Department requires that you have taken a wide range of challenging courses, 
especially in foundational areas such as algorithms, languages, systems, 
and software engineering with a solid record of achievement in all. 

.. index:: awards

Department Awards
--------------------------------------

Each year the Department recognizes exceptional graduate students in all of 
our degree programs. Awards are given for academics and service.
