Dr. Patricia Mooney-Melvin, Associate Dean, and Jessica Horowitz, Assistant Dean, are your primary contacts for inquiries. We recommend that you contact the department faculty and
staff first unless your matter absolutely requires Graduate School assistance.


Director of Graduate Programs
--------------------------------------

Regardless of the MS program in which you're enrolled, your main adviser will be the Director of Graduate Programs (abbreviated GPD). The current director is Dr. George K. Thiruvathukal. You are expected to confer with him regularly about your course of study in pursuit of your degree. You are encouraged to meet with the Director at other times as well to discuss your progress in the program and your future plans. 

Beginning in Fall 2013, we will be assigning a department advisor to you. 

Committee on Graduate Programs
--------------------------------------

The Director is advised on all matters of policy, admissions, and student status by the Committee on Graduate Programs.

   	"William L. Honig", "Associate Professor", "http://people.cs.luc.edu/wlhonig"

The faculty members of the Committee also serve as jury for various departmental awards.

Student ID Cards
--------------------------------------

Student ID cards, giving access to library borrowing and other privileges, are available from the Campus Card Office, Sullivan Center, Room 117.

Computer Services
--------------------------------------

The University maintains several Computer Centers which are available for your use in Sullivan Center, Information Commons, and at 25 E. Pearson. There are also personal computers available for the use of Graduate Assistants in the Graduate Student office space in Crown Center 418.

An account on the student email system is created automatically for each new student. Both the Director of Graduate Programs and the Graduate School will use this account to communicate with you. It is therefore crucial that you check your Loyola e-mailbox on a regular basis. Having your e-mail forwarded to another account can be risky. Some students find the mail doesn't always get delivered. If you find that you are not receiving regular and frequent communiqués from the Department, please notify the Secretary.

Students are encouraged to consult the Systems Handbook for more information about 
departmental and university computing resources. See http://syshandbook.cs.luc.edu/.

Bulletin Boards and Key Web Resources
--------------------------------------

The bulletin board outside the CS department on the 5th floor of Water Tower Campus features information regarding the graduate programs—e.g., calls for papers, job offerings, fellowship opportunities. The board in the department's main office has departmental notices.

You are also encouraged to keep abreast of the following departmental web resources:

The Emerging Technologies Laboratory
--------------------------------------

All graduate students in the BS and MS programs have access to a common space in the Water Tower Campus, Lewis Towers 409, also known as the Emerging Technologies Laboratory. Access is via the Loyola campus card.

Please contact the Department Secretary or Computer Systems Manager (add ref to personnel) for access, if you have trouble entering with your Loyola campus card.


Teaching Opportunities
--------------------------------------

In addition to occasional teaching assignments for Graduate Assistants (e.g. to help their instructor when he/she needs to be absent), a number of teaching opportunities are available to experienced graduate students and graduates who have gained experience since leaving our department (with a preference for the latter). The University requires that you have the MS degree; the Department requires that you have taken a wide range of challenging courses, especially in foundational areas such as algorithms, languages, systems, and software engineering with a solid record of achievement in all. 

The department chair, in consultation with the Director of Graduate Programs, assigns all classes. Funded students will be assigned classes routinely; unfunded students should apply directly to the department chair. The chairperson will invite applications for a limited number of summer teaching opportunities. The criteria used to assign summer classes to graduate students include: experience and proven success in the classroom; good progress toward the degree; preparedness to teach the courses available; and previous summer teaching (in an effort to distribute summer courses fairly). Contact the department chairperson for further information.


Summer Sessions
--------------------------------------

Two six-week summer sessions are offered through the Department each year, running from May to August. Two to four graduate-level courses are generally offered over the two summer terms.

We encourage research-minded students to consider independent study with a department faculty member.

Housing
--------------------------------------

Most graduate students choose to find their own off-campus apartments using the ads in the Reader, the Tribune, and other publicly available sources. Loyola’s Department of Residence Life also offers single- and double-occupancy apartments for graduate students on the Lakeshore Campus and the Water Tower Campus. For additional information, please see http://www.luc.edu/reslife.


Transportation
--------------------------------------

If you plan to commute to Loyola, there are several parking lots that you may use. The main parking structure, adjacent to Sheridan Road and to the Halas Sports Center, houses the Parking Office, where you may purchase a sticker for annual parking. The fee for one-day parking on campus is $7.00. At peak class times, available parking can sometimes be scarce. Street parking in the community immediately surrounding campus is scarce. It is also restricted to residents during certain hours, so be sure to read the signs carefully to avoid being ticketed by the police.

Parking is also available near the Water Tower Campus, although it is more expensive. You can have your parking stub stamped at the information desk at the 25 E. Pearson building to receive a modest discount. If you teach or take classes at the Water Tower Campus, you will probably want to acquaint yourself with the University’s inter-campus shuttle bus service. Public buses and the “El” run frequently between campuses and to other points in the city.

Further information on parking is available at http://www.luc.edu/parking/.
For information on the shuttle, see http://www.luc.edu/transportation/shuttlebus.shtml.


Publication
--------------------------------------

Research-oriented graduate students (especially those pursuing the *thesis option* in MS CS) are encouraged to pursue the publication of one or more journal articles during their graduate careers. In the current job market, publication is an important means of demonstrating to prospective employers a high level of motivation and professional competence. It can also be helpful for your future pursuits as a doctoral student (elsewhere).

Three ways to prepare for this goal are 1) to read journals in your fields of interest regularly in order to become familiar with both current scholarship and the requirements of scholarly publication; 2) to review the MLA Directory of Periodicals in order to learn what different journals expect or demand; and 3) to approach seminar papers, especially those in your field(s) of interest, as potential publications, possibly even as publications targeted to a particular journal. In developing a paper for publication, students are of course well advised to work closely with their seminar instructors or faculty mentors. In the recent past the Director of Graduate Programs and members of the graduate faculty have offered semester-long writing workshops for students writing for publication or writing their first conference presentations. You are advised to take advantage of such opportunities.


Conference Presentations and Travel Funding
-----------------------------------------------

Presentation of conference papers is an important part of students’ professional development, and MS CS students workking on thesis in particular should aim to give at least two papers during their graduate careers—preferably including professional and not just graduate-student conferences.

Each semester the Graduate School has funds to support graduate student travel for the purpose of presenting papers or chairing sessions at conferences. Since funds are limited, students should apply immediately upon acceptance of their papers or sessions. (Forms are available at http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/servicesandresources_forms.shtml).  The Department supplements these funds when the Graduate School’s funds are exhausted or when a student is presenting a paper at a second conference within one academic year. (Department forms are available on the Graduate Programs website http://luc.edu/english/links.shtml.) The Department also has funding for attending summer seminars or conducting dissertation research at a research library outside Chicago. These are competitive awards offered each semester. The current subvention from the Graduate School for travel is $400. Departmental travel support, which is funded primarily from the EGSA Student Activities budget, is likely to provide a much lower level of sponsorship. Research awards are provided through the Department’s Gravett-Tuma fund and are around $500 (depending on the number of awards and the funds available).


Career Center
--------------------------------------

The University’s Career Center, where each student entering the job market should establish a dossier containing letters of recommendation, is located in Sullivan Center, Room 295 (508-7716), with a very helpful website: http://www.luc.edu/career/RamberLink_Login.html

Students are encouraged to check our information jobs listings as well at http://jobs.cs.luc.edu. We are routinely contacted by employers who are seeking interns, consultants, and "permanent" employees.


Department Awards
--------------------------------------

Each year the Department recognizes exceptional graduate students in all of our degree programs. Awards are given for academics and service. The Graduate Advisory Committee is responsible for selecting the award winners.
