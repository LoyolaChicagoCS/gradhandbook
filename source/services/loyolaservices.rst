Summer Sessions
===============

Summer sessions are offered through the Department each year, running from May to August. There are two 6-week sessions and an overlapping 8-week session.

Three to five graduate-level courses are generally offered over these Summer terms, plus:

* :ref:`independent_study` with a department faculty member is encouraged for research-minded students. If you are starting in the Summer, this does not generally make sense.

* :ref:`internships`.

Housing
=======

Most graduate students choose to find their own off-campus apartments using the ads in the Reader, the Tribune, and other publicly available sources. Loyola’s Department of Residence Life also offers single- and double occupancy apartments for graduate students on the Lakeshore Campus and the Water Tower Campus, though these fill rapidly. For additional information, please see the links in http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/gradstudcmty.shtml under *Where To Live*.

Transportation
==============

Parking is available near the Water Tower Campus, although it is rather expensive. For sites listed in http://www.luc.edu/campustransportation/generalinformation/watertowercampus/ you can have your parking stub stamped at the information desk at the 25 E. Pearson building to receive a discount. As a current student, you will also want to acquaint yourself with the University’s inter-campus shuttle bus service. Public buses and the “El” run frequently between campuses and to other points in the city.

There is also parking available near the Lake Shore Campus. The main parking structure is adjacent to Sheridan Road and the Halas Sports Center.

Further information on parking and long term parking permits is available at http://www.luc.edu/parking/. For information on the shuttle, see http://www.luc.edu/transportation/shuttlebus.shtml.

Student ID Cards
================

After registering for classes, Student ID cards, which give access to library borrowing and other privileges, are available from Corboy Law Center, 25E. Pearson or the Campus Card Office, Sullivan Center, Room 117.

See http://www.luc.edu/campuscard/ for more information.

Computer Services
*****************

The University maintains several Computer Centers which are available for your use in Sullivan Center, Information Commons, and at 25 E. Pearson.

All university students are responsible for reading and following http://www.luc.edu/its/itspoliciesguidelines/policy_acceptableuse.shtml.

An account on the student email system is created automatically for each new student. Both the |gpd| and the Graduate School will use this account to communicate with you. It is therefore *crucial that you check your Loyola e-mailbox regularly.*

If you find that you are not receiving regular and frequent communiqués from the Department, please notify the Secretary.

.. warning::

    Having your e-mail forwarded to another account can be risky. Some students find the mail doesn't always get delivered.
