Teaching Assistantships
===========================

Each year the Computer Science department offers a small number of graduate assistantships 
for new and continuing students. Assistantships are competitive and
target students with exceptional 
computing background, regardless of which degree you are pursuing.  
Teaching-assistantship duties are assigned for up to 18 hours per week 
in computer labs, in support of faculty research projects, 
or in network or web support in the department.

Research Assistantships in computer science may also be available from 
time to time depending upon the availability of faculty research grants. 
Other units of the university sometimes offer TA awards for computer 
science students. There is no separate application for seeking a research 
assistantship or TA awards in other units of the university. 
All applications are initially reviewed by the Graduate Program Director.

New Students
--------------

New applicants to the Master's programs in computer science who wish to apply 
for financial support should check the box under the Merit Award Information 
section of the application form for the question: 
"Do you wish to be considered for a Merit Award?" 

For new students who receive an assistantship, it is customary for the department
to make a commitment to the end of the academic 
year, with an understanding to continue for up to a total of three semesters
if funds are available for the next academic year, and if the students 
maintain their academic and work standards.

The aim is to announce the awards in early May for Fall, and November for Spring.

New Student Requirements and Deadlines
---------------------------------------

* Have excellent undergraduate performance, including all MS prerequisites.
* International students should have a strong TOEFL or IELTS score.
* Submit excellent letters of recommendation for graduate admission.
* Submit official GRE scores.
* Have your application complete, with the request for a merit award,
  by the *deadline* date of *March 15 for Fall admission* or 
  *October 15 for Spring admission*.
  New merit awards are not given for summer semesters.
* Around  the deadline date, or shortly thereafter, promptly fill out the
  online form at a URL  
  emailed from the GPD. The form asks for more information
  to help the department choose awardees. Make sure in your application
  that you had an *email address that you check regularly*, or update
  your current email address with the GPD (gpd@cs.luc.edu).

If you miss these deadlines you may apply in your first semester or later 
as a *current* student.

Current Student Requirements and Deadlines
--------------------------------------------

Continuing students' 
*recent academic experience at Loyola* is
the most important consideration in giving a new award.  

Continuing students will get an 
*emailed reminder to their Loyola address several weeks before the deadline*.  The
reminder will include the URL for an online form to fill out as your application.
Note that the deadlines are *earlier* than for just admitted students:

  Continuing students fill out the online form by *March 1 for Fall awards*, 
  and by *October 1 for Spring awards*.

Students who have already been given an award for the upcoming semester should
not fill out the form.

Possible English Exam Given By Loyola
---------------------------------------

Awardees who did not grow up in the US may be required by the Graduate
School to take an extra English test on campus, even if they have other 
English language certifications.  The standards for TA's are higher than the
entrance requirements.  Someone who did not score high enough on the Loyola
test will be required to take ESL, and pay the extra tuition.  The 
cost has generally been about the same as one regular graduate academic credit.
