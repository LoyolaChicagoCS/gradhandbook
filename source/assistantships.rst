Teaching Assistantships
===========================

Each year the Computer Science department offers a small number of graduate assistantships 
for new and continuing students. Assistantships target students with exceptional 
computing background, regardless of which degree you are pursuing.  
You should therefore assume that assistantships are competitive. 

For new students who receive an assistantship, it is customary to make a full academic 
year commitment, which is renewable for up to two additional semesters.

Continuing students who do not have an assistantship extending into the next semester 
may apply for an assistantship.  Continuing students recent academic 
experience at Loyola is
the most important consideration in giving a new award.  
 
Continuing students should get an emailed reminder to their Loyola address
several weeks before the deadline.  The
reminder will include the URL for an online form to fill out as your application.
Note that the deadlines are *earlier* than for just admitted students:

* Applications for the following academic year are due February 28/29.  
* If you miss that date you can apply for Spring by October 1.

The aim is to announce the awards in early May for Fall, and November for Spring.
