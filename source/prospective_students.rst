Prospective Students
====================

Overview of Loyola MS Programs' Strengths
---------------------------------------------

*   Committed faculty teaching small classes, commonly 15-25 students
*   Lots of project based classes with big concepts for all, which students 
    get to develop in their own way in their individual projects, 
    with active individual support from the instructor
*   Flexibility and breadth: At least ½ of each program is electives 
    which can vary from business-centric, data-centric, 
    networking and security, software engineering, 
    to core computer science. 
    Many students come in not knowing exactly what they are most interested in. 
    Students can sample different areas, 
    choose to change the degree program in the middle, 
    and still have all their courses count toward the final degree.
*   Enroll part-time or full-time, and back and forth, as you choose
*   Strong advising/support throughout: 
    as students inquire about the program, apply, plan initial courses, 
    and as experience evolves
*   Lots of data on and opportunities for internships and jobs: 
    Internships can count in the academic program. 
    High regard of our program in industry smooths job transition.
*   Strong encouragement toward independent study with 
    individual professors in a wide variety of areas
*   Finish full-time in 16 months; 
    less if you can get two courses of transfer credit
*   Opportunity for discipline changers to be accepted and take 
    prerequisites with us on a compressed schedule

Admissions
----------

.. index:: deadline; admission

**No application deadline for plain admission**:
Applications are continuously evaluated and students 
will be promptly admitted to the nearest starting term or semester.    
Earlier admission means that you get to register online for classes earlier,
and some classes may fill up.  See :ref:`new_student_merit`, for 
*application deadlines to be considered for such an award*.

**Prerequisites**:  
Please note that you can apply and be accepted without 
having all the undergraduate prerequisites listed for degree programs. 
See the section on :ref:`prerequisites`.

.. CHECK GPD

**Questions**:  If you have questions after reading the information below, 
contact the Graduate Program Director at gpd@cs.luc.edu.  You are encouraged
to :ref:`visit`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are an international student please refer to 
:ref:`prospective_international_graduate_students`.

For admission to the graduate degree program in the 
Department of Computer Science, 
submit the items below that are not listed as optional. 
You may also submit further items if you feel they would 
help bolster your admissions case.

#.   Completed application form (either completed 
     `online <https://gpem.luc.edu/apply/>`_ with no fee or 
     `downloaded <http://www.luc.edu/gpem/applications/gpemapplication.pdf>`_ 
     and delivered on paper with a $50 fee).
#.   Those who would like to get financial assistance see 
     :ref:`teaching_assistantships` or for non-departmental
     financial aid see http://www.luc.edu/finaid/responsibilities_rights.shtml.
#.   Submit official transcripts of all undergraduate work and any 
     post-baccalaureate work still in sealed envelopes sent from the academic 
     institution. Do not open such envelopes yourself.  If you do not have
     easy access to the sealed official documents, you can initially submit
     copies for a conditional admission.
#.   GRE scores are not required for admission. 
     If you choose to submit them, Loyola's institutional code is 1412; 
     the department code is not needed. 
     GRE scores, however, are expected if you are applying for a merit award 
     ( :ref:`teaching_assistantships` ), 
     and you are not already a Loyola student.
#.  Three letters of recommendation. 
    These are usually from referees familiar with the applicant's academic work, 
    however, if the applicant has been out of school for a long time, 
    then letters of recommendation from co-workers or supervisors 
    will be acceptable.

Prospective International Graduate Students
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

US nationals having an American undergraduate Bachelor's degree should consult 
:ref:`prospective_us_graduate_students`.

For international student admission to the graduate degree program in the 
Department of Computer Science, 
submit the items below that are not listed as optional. 
You may also submit further items if you feel they would help bolster 
your admissions case.

#.   Completed application form (either completed 
     `online <https://gpem.luc.edu/apply/>`_ with no fee or 
     `downloaded <http://www.luc.edu/gpem/applications/gpemapplication.pdf>`_ 
     and delivered on paper with a $50 fee).
#.   Those who would like to get financial assistance see 
     :ref:`teaching_assistantships` or for non-departmental
     financial aid see http://www.luc.edu/finaid/responsibilities_rights.shtml.
#.   International applicants 
     (including those who are seeking financial aid from the department) 
     are encouraged to submit proof (affidavit) of financial support to our 
     International students office simultaneously with filing their application. 
     This will help save a lot of time in processing the visa papers, 
     namely I-20 or IAP-66, at the earliest. 
     Students who are chosen for the merit awards or scholarships will be 
     notified regardless of their financial standing or ability to support 
     themselves financially.
#.   Submit official transcripts of all undergraduate work and any 
     post-baccalaureate work still in sealed envelopes sent from the 
     academic institution. **Do not open such envelopes yourself**. 
     If you do not have
     easy access to the sealed official documents, you can initially submit
     copies for a conditional admission.
     Students with transcripts issued by International universities or colleges 
     must be evaluated by an outside evaluator for GPA calculation and 
     determining if the degree is equivalent to an American Bachelor's degree: 
     Applicants may send international transcripts for a general evaluation 
     with **Grade Average** to `ECE <https://www.ece.org/>`_ 
     for basic international evaluation and *allow 4-6 weeks* 
     for them to evaluate transcripts and get the results to Loyola. 
     `Educational-Perspectives <http://edperspective.org/>`_ 
     can also be used as an alternative to ECE. No other transcript evaluation
     service is accepted by Loyola.
     Those students seriously considering Loyola can write to the 
     Graduate Program Director at gpd@cs.luc.edu for waiving the 
     transcript evaluation fee. 
     Requesting that Loyola handle the evaluation will require extra time, 
     since the transcript forms must be received by Loyola and sent again to ECE.
#.   GRE scores are not required for admission. 
     If you choose to submit them, Loyola's institutional code is 1412; 
     the department code is not needed. 
     GRE scores, however, are expected if you are applying for a merit award 
     ( :ref:`teaching_assistantships` ), 
     and you are not already a Loyola student.
#.   Three letters of recommendation. 
     These are usually from referees familiar with the applicant's 
     academic work, however, 
     if the applicant has been out of school for a long time, 
     then letters of recommendation from co-workers or 
     supervisors will be acceptable.
#.   International students must also earn at least at least
     79 on the internet-based test; or at least a 6.5 on the IELTS academic test. 
     Loyola's institutional code for the TOEFL is 1412; 
     the department code is not needed. 
     These *are* the cutoffs: 
     *Do not request to be admitted with a lower score*, 
     but you can *retake* an English exam as many times as you need 
     to to get up to a passing grade. 
     Loyola has *no* program for conditional admission without the required
     score.
     
     If taking one of these tests, be sure to sign up for an early test date, 
     since results take 4-6 weeks to be delivered to Loyola.
     
     Students with Bachelor's degrees from accredited institutions in the US, 
     United Kingdom, Canada, Australia or New Zealand, 
     who primarily attended their classes in those countries, 
     are *exempt* from the English requirement. 
     

International students requiring an F-1 visa should consult the 
`International Students and Scholars <http://www.luc.edu/iss/outside.shtml>`_
page.

Though there is no admission deadline,
be sure to leave time to get the necessary official English test results and 
transcript evaluations to Loyola before admission, 
and allow time after admission for obtaining a visa.
