Prospective Students
====================

Overview of Loyola MS Programs' Strengths
---------------------------------------------

*   Committed faculty teaching small classes, commonly 15-25 students
*   Many project based classes with big concepts for all, which students 
    get to develop in their own way in their individual projects, 
    with active individual support from the instructor
*   Flexibility and breadth: About ½ of each program is electives 
    which can vary from business-centric, data-centric, 
    networking and security, software engineering, 
    to core computer science. 
    Many students come in not knowing exactly what they are most interested in. 
    Students can sample different areas, 
    choose to change the degree program in the middle, 
    and still have all their courses count toward the final degree.
*   Enroll part-time or full-time, and back and forth, as you choose
*   Strong advising/support throughout: 
    as students inquire about the program, apply, plan initial courses, 
    and as experience evolves
*   Lots of data on and opportunities for internships and jobs: 
    Internships can count in the academic program. 
    High regard of our program in industry smooths job transition.
*   Strong encouragement toward independent study with 
    individual professors in a wide variety of areas
*   Finish full-time in 16 months; 
    less if you can get two courses of transfer credit
*   Opportunity for discipline changers to be accepted and take 
    prerequisites with us on a compressed schedule

Admissions
----------

.. index:: deadline; admission

**No application deadline for plain admission**:
Applications are continuously evaluated and students 
will be promptly admitted to the nearest starting term or semester.    
Earlier admission means that you get to register online for classes earlier,
and some classes may fill up.  See :ref:`new_student_merit`, for 
*application deadlines to be considered for such an award*.

**Prerequisites**:  
Please note that you can apply and be accepted without 
having all the undergraduate prerequisites listed for degree programs. 
See the section of the course document on 
`prerequisites <http://courses.cs.luc.edu/html/masters_prereqs.html>`_.

Requirements for All Applicants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For admission to the graduate degree program in the 
Department of Computer Science, 
submit the items below that are not listed as optional. 
You may also submit further items if you feel they would 
help bolster your admissions case.
If you are an international student please *also* note the 
:ref:`additional_requirements_for_international_applicants`.

#.   Completed application form (either completed 
     `online <https://gpem.luc.edu/apply/>`_ with no fee or 
     `downloaded <http://www.luc.edu/gpem/applications/gpemapplication.pdf>`_ 
     and delivered on paper with a $50 fee).
#.   Those who would like to get financial assistance see 
     :ref:`teaching_assistantships` or for non-departmental
     financial aid see http://www.luc.edu/finaid/responsibilities_rights.shtml.
#.   Submit official English transcripts of all undergraduate work and any 
     post-baccalaureate work still in sealed envelopes sent from the academic 
     institution. Do not open such envelopes yourself.  If you do not have
     easy access to the sealed official documents, you can *initially* submit
     copies for a *conditional* admission.
#.   GRE scores are not required for admission. 
     If you choose to submit them, Loyola's institutional code is 1412; 
     the department code is not needed. 
     GRE scores, however, are expected if you are applying for a merit award 
     ( :ref:`teaching_assistantships` ), 
     and you are not already a Loyola student.
#.  Three letters of recommendation. 
    These are usually from referees familiar with the applicant's academic work, 
    however, if the applicant has been out of school for a long time, 
    then letters of recommendation from co-workers or supervisors 
    will be acceptable.

.. index:: FAFSA

.. _FAFSA:

FAFSA for U.S. Students/Permanent Residents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Though *not* a requirement, U.S. citizens and permanent residents 
are strongly encouraged to fill out the
online FAFSA form at https://fafsa.ed.gov/. 
This not only facilitates loans, but also can help getting 
on-campus jobs.

.. _additional_requirements_for_international_applicants:

Additional Requirements for International Applicants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not forget the :ref:`requirements_for_all_applicants`.  Here are 
*additional* requirements and an option for international student admission 
to a graduate degree program in the 
Department of Computer Science.

#.   Students with transcripts issued by International universities or colleges 
     must be *evaluated* by an outside evaluator for GPA calculation and 
     determining if the degree is equivalent to an American Bachelor's degree: 
     Applicants may send international transcripts for a general evaluation 
     with **Grade Average** to `ECE <https://www.ece.org/>`_ 
     for international evaluation and *allow 4-6 weeks* 
     for them to evaluate transcripts and get the results to Loyola. 
     `Educational-Perspectives <http://edperspective.org/>`_ 
     can also be used as an alternative to ECE. No other transcript evaluation
     service is accepted by Loyola.  If you are in a rush, you can pay extra
     for expedited service.
     
     **A suggested exception to getting the** *general* **transcript evaluation:**
     If you have international graduate level coursework after 4 years of 
     college level work, see :ref:`international_transfer`.
     
     Those students living abroad and seriously considering Loyola can write to the 
     Graduate Program Director at gpd@cs.luc.edu about waiving the 
     transcript evaluation fee. Be sure the *rest* of your application is
     submitted when making this request, so it can be properly considered.
     At least a copy of a passing English test score must be included at that
     time:  an official result is just needed before admission.
     Requesting that Loyola handle the evaluation will require *extra time*, 
     since the transcript forms must be received first by Loyola 
     and sent off again to Educational Perspectives.
#.   International students (with the exception of U.S. citizens or permanent residents)
     must have their English certified *before* any kind of admission.  
     
     *Informally* the Gradute Program Director (GPD) 
     is happy to look at an application that is complete except 
     for the English requirement, and let you know if you should expect the GPD's 
     recommendation for admission, *after* an 
     official passing English result is provided.  
     Later, the Graduate School Dean's approval is still needed for final admission.
     
     The Loyola Graduate School accepts just two approaches to the English 
     requirement, and a few explicit exceptions:
     
     *   The usual way is to earn at least
         79 on the internet-based TOEFL test (or 550 on the paper-based test) 
         or at least a 6.5 (overall band score) on the IELTS academic test. 
         The *official results must come to Loyola directly* 
         *from the testing agency*. 
         Loyola's institutional code is 1412; 
         the department code is not needed. 
         The Graduate School will not accept scores lower than those stated 
         above, and our department is not able to make any exceptions. 
         *Do not request to be admitted with a lower score.*
         Loyola has no official program for conditional admission 
         without the required score.
     
         You can *retake* an English exam as many times as you need
         *before* admission to get up to a passing grade. 

         If taking one of these tests, be sure to sign up for an early test date, 
         since results usually take 2-3 weeks to be delivered *officially* to Loyola.
     
     *   If you want to improve your English at Loyola, in preparation for 
         possible graduate study, you can *first* 
         apply to our full-time ESL program, http://www.luc.edu/esl/, 
         and do well enough in courses and a comprehensive exam.  Only sufficient
         achievement in *Loyola's*
         ESL program is a substitute for one of the standardized tests above.
         Enrollment in an ESL program at another school is not a substitute 
         for the TOEFL or IELTS. With any other ESL program one of the 
         standardized tests is still required.
         
         NOTE:  Loyola's ESL is a separate program from the Graduate School.
         Appropriate certification from this ESL program merely 
         satisfies the English requirement for Graduate School applicants.  
         It does not imply the Graduate School Dean's approval for your 
         admission.  All other
         parts of your application remain to be considered.
     
     *   The English requirement is *waived* only for students who satisfy
         at least one of the following:
     
         *   U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
         *   Students with Bachelor's or higher degree from accredited 
             institutions in the United States, 
             United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia or New Zealand, 
             who primarily attended their classes in those countries.  
             Students are exempt who 
             will complete one of these programs before matriculation at Loyola,
             even if they have further degrees from another country.  
             Note: Graduating from a program offered in English from any *other* country 
             does *not* exempt the student from the English requirement.
         *   Students who have written and defended a masters thesis or 
             doctoral dissertation in English.      
         
#.   International applicants who will be on an F-1 visa
     (including those who are seeking financial aid from the department) 
     are encouraged to submit proof (affidavit) of financial support to our 
     International students office *simultaneously* with filing their application. 
     The form should be linked on the page
     http://luc.edu/iss/forms.shtml
     under something like the name,
     Declaration of Finances for Graduate & Professional Students.
     This will help save a lot of time in processing the visa papers, 
     namely I-20 or IAP-66. 
     Students who are chosen for the merit awards or scholarships will be 
     notified regardless of their financial standing or ability to support 
     themselves financially.     

International students requiring an F-1 visa should consult the 
`International Students and Scholars <http://www.luc.edu/iss/outside.shtml>`_
page for further information.

Though there is no admission deadline,
be sure to leave time to get the necessary official English test results and 
transcript evaluations to Loyola before admission, 
and allow time after admission for obtaining a visa.  If the process takes too 
long, you can roll your admission over to the next semester.
