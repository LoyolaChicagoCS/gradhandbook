Download Other Formats
=========================

In addition to the html version on the server, http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu,
we also provide the following formats for offline reading:

- `PDF <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/latex/LoyolaComputerScienceGradHandbook.pdf>`_ 
  for printing or desktop reading
- `ePub <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/epub/LoyolaComputerScienceGradHandbook.epub>`_ 
  (for e-reading devices, e.g. e-readers, tablets, or Adobe Digital Editions on desktop)

All these different formats are generated using the incredible 
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ 
documentation tools from the `Python <http://python.org>`_ community.

You can view the source text files from which all versions are derived at 
https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoCS/gradhandbook.  The site also shows 
a change log.
