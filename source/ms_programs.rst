Master of Science Programs
======================================

Overview
-----------

Information Technology is more management and business process facing.  
It is distinguished from a pure business degree by its requirement and 
frequent use of basic programming and other technical skills.  
If you end up managing technical workers, 
you will have an edge over those with pure business degrees.

Software Engineering is focused on knowledge and abilities to produce 
high quality software for many different domains.

Computer Science is more foundational, 
requiring you to get experience with a broad range of core 
computer science concepts.  It is our only program with a thesis option.  
Students from this program are the ones most likely to go on to a PhD program.

Computer Science is a broad and moving target. 
The full range of electives common to all programs is very helpful 
in providing breadth and flexibility. 
Only 3-5 courses out of 10 are specified or limited by the individual program. 
The overlap also means that it is generally fairly easy to switch programs 
if your interest is particularly stimulated by an elective more strongly 
associated with another program.

Prerequisites
---------------

All students need the equivalent knowledge 
of Comp 170: Introductory Programming and
Comp 271: Data Structures. The topics for these courses are outlined in
:ref:`programming_prerequisites`.
This knowledge is prerequisite to essentially all
the graduate courses in the Computer Science Department, with the exception of 
COMP 417: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Computing.

Students in the Computer Science Graduate Program need the strongest preparation.
Most will have an undergraduate degree or at least the first two years
of foundational undergraduate courses.  This would include the addition of 
equivalents of our
Comp 163 (Discrete Structures) and
264 (Computer Systems) to the two courses already listed. 

Software Engineering students are in the middle.   
The background for the Computer Science student is helpful, but adept
transitioning students may manage with the courses two basic courses 
that the IT students need.

Many of our best students in Information Technology and Software Engineering
have transitioned from other fields.

**You can handle missing prerequisite knowledge in a number of ways**:

#. Take them somewhere else 
   (possibly cheaper and more convenient to your location, 
   but possibly not as good or not covering mostly what we want)
#. Take them at Loyola:  Take just the courses we want, with support of our faculty, 
   giving you an opportunity to get into our community and build relationships 
   with faculty and students.
    
   * This can be done before entering the Graduate program as a non-degree undergrad 
     (cheaper undergraduate tuition).  
   * Or you can do prep courses while taking a graduate course that does not 
     require the prerequisites. (faster full-time finish!)

In fall or spring you have the opportunity to take a compressed intensive 
sequence of prerequisites in one semester:  two 7-8 weeks courses in succession.  
Comp 388 Foundations I+II.  These cover at least the content of Comp 170 and 271.
You can be a full-time graduate student at the same 
time by adding the required Comp 417 on Ethics and Social issues, 
which has no prerequisite.  

Dr. Harrington's free online text is used for Foundations I, 
and it assumes no background.  
It has the full contact hours of a regular 15 week course, but in 7-8 weeks.  
You are welcomed to look at or independently use the materials on the course web site 
http://anh.cs.luc.edu/388Intro, including the text and videos linked there.  
Starting to look early is advised, since 6 1/4 hours of class a week and 
all the work that goes with it does require some dedication!   
Some of the transitioning students with full-time jobs have found this to be 
*too much* to take on even as their *only* course.

For students with a fairly pure humanities background, 
and very little sequential symbolic experience, 
you may want to take a slower approach through traditional undergraduate courses, 
but this will slow you down by at least an extra semester.

Please contact the Graduate Program Director with any questions at gpd@cs.luc.edu. 

The next section, :ref:`programming_prerequisites`, lists more details 
of material you should know before taking graduate courses in our department.

Two Basic Programming Prerequisites
------------------------------------

Knowledge of the content below is prerequisite for almost all 
of the graduate courses in the Computer Science Department.

The descriptions below are for the courses at Loyola, in a 
pretty standard introductory sequence.
If you took these subjects elsewhere, you are not likely to have the exact 
same collection of topics, but if you are close, 
there should not be much problem filling holes as needed. 

**Expectations from COMP 170/ISOM 370**

List of top ten concepts you should understand at the end of COMP 170/ISOM 370, 
Introductory Object Oriented Programming (in Java, C#, C++ or a similar
language):

#. Be able to distinguish between class and instance

   *   Class is abstract representation or model (class aka type, abstract type, 
       factory for objects). Class has field definitions (or attribute definitions) 
       and operations (or methods) to implement its behaviors.
   *   Instance (aka class instance, variable) is an actual, specific, 
       concrete thing and has specific field values (or attribute values).
   *   All instances of a class share the same operations and attribute definitions.

#. Know syntax rules and coding style

   *   Learn the basic picky rules of Java syntax and use them correctly. 
       Key items: placement of “;” use of case (“ClassSchedule” vs. “classSchedule”); 
       distinguish declarations and executable statements.
   *   Format code readably according to agreed upon style.

#. Use conditional control structures fully and correctly

   *   Construct programs with “if….then”, and “if….then…else”. 
       Understand nesting of control statements and blocks ( “{“ and “}”).
   *   Briefly, “Nesting, blocks, no dangles”.

#. Construct loops with control structures

   *   Use “while”, “do”, and “for” control structures to 
       implement algorithms successfully.
   *   Briefly, “avoid never ending loops, avoid off-by-one problems”

#. Use the primitive types and operators appropriately

   *   Understand the use and limitations of the primitive Java types.
   *   Know the most useful arithmetic, relational, and logical operators 
       and use them in expressions, with parentheses when necessary.

#. Lean how to create good OO encapsulation

   *   Achieve a deep understanding of the proper use of the access modifiers 
       “private”, and “public”.
   *   Be able to design well structured classes.
   *   Know when and how to use “static”.

#. Construct and understand methods fully

   *   Define and use methods, including formal parameters and return values.
   *   Distinguish between formal parameters (aka parameters) and arguments 
       in the call to a method.
   *   Comprehend scope and lifetime of objects. Understand visibility of 
       objects and how to implement finding the right object at the necessary time.
   *   Know how to ask a particular instance of a class to do something. 
       Know how to construct associations between classes.
   *   Understand what is happening is a nested stack of method calls.

#. Be knowledgeable about important library container classes and arrays

   *   Be able to declare and use containers like ArrayList and arrays. 
       Understand how to find things in containers and arrays. 
       Use index variables effectively.

#. Perform simple input/output processing

   *   Lean how to do basic input and output statements with an interactive user 
       and with files. Be able to work with Strings.

#. Understand OO Interfaces

   *   Know how to define and use simple interfaces like List.
 
**Expectations from Data Structures, COMP 271**

#. OOP

   *   Be able to write interface/abstract classes and implementations of data structures.
   *   Understand subclassing mechanisms.
   *   Understand overloading, overriding, dynamic binding, 
       boxing and unboxing in OOP languages.

#. Mathematical context

   *   Big-Oh notation, worst-case run time complexity and 
       storage complexity of algorithms.
   *   Be able to do performance analysis of code using big-Oh.

#. Data structures

   *   Know and be able to use and implement abstract data types such as stacks, 
       arraylists, vectors, queues, linked lists, hash tables, and hash sets.
   *   Understand the time complexities of operations such as insert, delete, 
       add, retrieve, on the above data structures and be able to obtain 
       time complexities of other operations on similar, simple data structures.
   *   Knowledge of hash functions, trees, graphs, and two dimensional arrays.
   *   Knowledge of algorithms for problems including searching, 
       and sorting (Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort etc.), string manipulations.

#. Core programming language concepts

   *   Knowledge of programming language storage paradigms such as static, 
       stack, and heap.
   *   Be able to understand and use recursion in various problems.

MS in Computer Science
----------------------------

The MS in Computer Science provides foundations of Computer Science, while
acknowledging that Computer Science is key to algorithms in the sciences.
Other programs in the Computer Science Department with different foci are 
:ref:`ms_in_information_technology` and the :ref:`ms_in_software_engineering`.

This program is for students entering the program in Spring 2014 or later.
If you were enrolled in the program prior to Spring 2014 you may use the older
degree requirements located at http://luc.edu/cs/academics/graduateprograms/mscs/oldcurriculum.

.. include:: common_program_features.inc

Overall, to achieve depth and breadth, Computer Science students must 
complete the following:

*   Three (3) required courses.
*   Three (3) restricted electives. 
*   Four (4) courses or 12 credits that are general electives.

Required Courses (9 credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following three courses are required by the program:

* Comp 417: Social, Ethical and Legal Issues in Computing
* Comp 413: Intermediate Object-Oriented Development
* Comp 460: Algorithms and Complexity

The Graduate Program Director may approve the replacement of 
Comp 413 by an additional course on the Restricted Electives list in cases 
where the student's primary program focus is not on software development.

Restricted Electives (9 credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
MS-CS students must also take three courses from the following list:

General Electives (12 Credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: general_electives.inc

.. index:: thesis option

.. _thesis_option:

Thesis Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MS students in the Computer Science degree program (only) 
may elect the MS thesis option.

Course work is strongly recommended over the thesis option, 
especially for those not planning on a research-oriented career. Many students
pursuing the thesis option, therefore, 
would be considering a PhD program at another institution. 

Students wishing to do a thesis should discuss this option as early as 
possible with the GPD. 

Theses may involve research in purely theoretical computer science 
(for example, development or analysis of algorithms), 
or may involve development of a software package, 
or may involve instrumentation, measurement and analysis of existing systems 
(for example, studying network performance). 
Because of this wide range, there is no one
formal course in research methods. 
Courses in the restricted-electives list above contain a significant 
component of area-specific integrated research-methods material. 
Students interested in writing a thesis are strongly urged to seek 
advising from the GPD or other faculty as early as possible as to which 
electives in this group will be the most appropriate for the student's 
proposed area of research.

Here is an outline of the steps toward your thesis.  The ones in boldface
are formal steps with documentation required by the Graduate School:

#.  If you wish to write a thesis, first identify a faculty advisor and 
    select a tentative topic or area of research. 
    The existing program allows you to take up to 6.0 hours of 
    Comp 490: Independent Study. 
    You will typically begin their research program in such a course, 
    though you may also identify an advisor and select a tentative topic 
    as part of a conventional classroom course.

#.  Thesis/Dissertation Committee Recommendation

    -  The next step is for you to secure permission to pursue the thesis 
       option from the Graduate Program Director. 
    -  The Graduate Program Director, in consultation with you and your 
       chosen advisor, recommends a thesis committee to the Graduate School. 
       The committee will consist of at least three faculty members; 
       normally the committee director will be the advisor.  
    -  **For the formal Graduate School process** 
       **you create the committee at the gsps link**
       https://gsps.luc.edu/. An email will then
       be sent to the director for approval and then the GPD.
    -  You will receives an email if your committee is formally approved by
       the Graduate School.

    At least 50% of the committee must be comprised of Loyola graduate
    faculty; the director of the committee must have full graduate faculty
    status – see
    http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/about\_facultystaff.shtml
    for the current list of full members.

#.  Once the committee is approved, you may continue with your 
    research in subsequent semesters registering for the 
    zero-credit-hour Comp 595: Thesis Supervision, if available, or  
    Comp 605: Masters Study, if Comp 595 is not listed.  If you still
    need credit hours and have not already had the full number of hours
    of Comp 490, you can register for that instead.
    Students may register for any number of semesters of Comp 595/605, 
    subject to time-to-degree-completion constraints.

#.  Once you have your thesis committee approved, 
    the thesis becomes a degree requirement. 
    (This is important for international students.) 
    You may, however, petition to revert back to non-thesis status; 
    this requires permission of the Graduate Program Director and the Graduate School. 
    At that point, you would be able to graduate without writing a thesis, 
    if the coursework requirements were met. 
    No reimbursement or credit will be received for any Comp 595, Comp 605, 
    or other thesis-specific courses taken.

#.  Ballot for the Approval of a Thesis/Dissertation Proposal

    -  You will then prepare a formal research proposal, 
       in consultation with your advisor.
       This proposal must be submitted to your committee for review.  
       This sequence is monitored through gsps.
    -  If you are submitting your proposal to the Institutional Review Board
       (IRB), you must have approval or exemption *before* the Graduate
       School approves your proposal. You do not need to submit proof,
       Graduate School will confirm. 
       (This step is required for the use of human and animal subjects,
       and is not common for Computer Science.)
    -  **A simple one to two paragraph abstract must be included**
       **in the proposal form on gsps.**
    -  You will get notified once all members of the committee, the GPD,
       and the Graduate School approve the proposal through gsps.
    -  You are now ready to "conduct research" for the project. 
  
#.  Ballot for Text and Oral Defense Form

    -  Upon completion of your thesis, you will be required to formally
       defend your research. Schedule this with your committee.
       You thesis should be in nearly final form.
    -  Typically you should give the committee three weeks to read the final
       draft of the thesis before the defense date.
    -  **For this requirement, you must download the defense ballot**
       http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/T%20&%20D%20defense%20ballot--DB.pdf
       and bring it with you to your defense. Your director and other
       committee member(s) will sign the ballot – this ballot then needs to
       go to the GPD for final approval. 
    -  The committee may require modifications before approving the thesis,
       or possibly reject it.
    -  Once approved, the GPD will upload
       the ballot in gsps for Graduate School approval. 
    -  You will be notified
       once the process is complete.
  

#.  Formatting the Thesis/Dissertation

    -   Every thesis/dissertation needs to be formatted according to the rules
        stated in the Graduate School's formatting manual
        http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/formatting.shtml.
    -   **Format check is a required step**; the deadlines, depending on the
        conferral date, are posted on the Key Dates and Deadlines page on the
        Graduate School website.  These deadlines are well before the end of the
        semester - be sure to check and satisfy them.
    -   **Final Copy, both electronic and hard copies also have deadlines**,
        depending on the conferral date.

MA in Digital Humanities
-----------------------------

The Computer Science department is a partner in the MA in Digital Humanities program. 
While not a department-specific
program, we encourage students with interdisciplinary interests at the 
intersection of culture and technology to 
consider this degree, which allows one to elect courses from the CS department.

The Digital Humanities MA program at Loyola Unviersity's
Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities (CTSDH) combines 
theoretical and practical courses. 
Its aims are ultimately practical and professional, 
training new digital specialists for the growing knowledge and 
information economy and today's research in humanities disciplines. 
Because the nature of much Digital Humanities work is constructive and project-based, 
students in the M.A. program will be given hands-on training in workshop 
or seminar-based classes, training in text editing and text encoding, 
electronic publishing and platforms, programming, interface design, project management, 
and archive construction. At every stage, 
team-based collaborative learning will be encouraged, in class projects, 
for example, and potentially in the required electronic thesis project. 
But the MA program also explores theoretical, critical, social, 
and ethical contexts for thinking about Digital Humanities research and applications, 
including issues of intellectual property, data and privacy, public access and preservation. 

For details about this program, see http://www.luc.edu/ctsdh/academics/maindigitalhumanities/.


Pursuing Multiple MS Degrees
-------------------------------

We are often asked about whether it is possible to complete more than one MS degree 
(e.g. and MS in Computer Science and an MS in Software Engineering). 
The answer is no, unless you complete 54 hours of study (30 hours of courses for
the each degree, except for 6 credits transfered into the second degree). 
It is impractical and expensive, and we don't think it serves students well. 
Our goal is to prepare you
for a serious career (professional and/or academic) 
after completing *one* graduate degree.

Students who wish to continue taking courses may do so after completing their degree 
as non-degree students. We also
encourage our students to maintain connections through our professional 
and social networking groups. Many of our
students continue to be involved in research laboratories such as the 
Emerging Technologies Laboratory
(see http://www.etl.luc.edu).

.. index:: time for program

Time and Residence Requirements
------------------------------------------

Normally it takes 16 months for full-time students to earn a 
MS in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Information Technology from Loyola. 
Students who attend part time must complete the program within five years. 
This period may be extended only by special action of the Dean of the Graduate School.
The MS in Computer Science with the thesis option may also need extra time.
