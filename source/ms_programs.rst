Master of Science Programs
======================================

MS in Computer Science
----------------------------

The MS in Computer Science provides foundations of Computer Science, while
acknowledging that Computer Science is key to algorithms in the sciences.
Other programs in the Computer Science Department with different foci are the
MS in Software Engineering and the MS in Information Technology.

For details about this program, see http://luc.edu/cs/academics/graduateprograms/mscs/

MS in Software Engineering
----------------------------

The MS in Software Engineering caters to students interested in software engineering and also other contemporary topics of long-term value to the industry. Most early careers in the industry are based on either software development or managerial aspects of software development. This degree places more weight on software development. For those seeking a greater focus on managerial aspects, we offer the M.S. in Information Technology (MS-IT) below.

For details about this program, see http://luc.edu/cs/academics/graduateprograms/msse/.

MS in Information Technology
------------------------------


The Master of Science in Information Technology is designed for current and aspiring professionals in charge of developing, implementing, operating, and managing information systems in a variety of organizations. Students in this program will gain a broad technical understanding of current and emerging technologies in the industry, a familiarity with systems engineering concepts, and a solid foundation in net-centric computing. They will also have a firm grasp of current and future effects of the convergence of the telecommunications, media, and information technology sectors. All course work can be completed online, and the program includes an intensive on-site immersion as a capstone.

MA in Digital Humanities
-----------------------------

The Computer Science department is a partner in the MA in Digital Humanities program. While not a department-specific
program, we encourage students with interdisciplinary interests at the intersection of culture and technology to 
consider this degree, which allows one to elect courses from the CS department.

The Digital Humanities MA program at Loyola Unviersity's CTSDH combines theoretical and practical courses. Its aims are ultimately practical and professional, training new digital specialists for the growing knowledge and information economy and today's research in humanities disciplines. Because the nature of much Digital Humanities work is constructive and project-based, students in the M.A. program will be given hands-on training in workshop or seminar-based classes, training in text editing and text encoding, electronic publishing and platforms, programming, interface design, project management, and archive construction. At every stage, team-based collaborative learning will be encouraged, in class projects, for example, and potentially in the required electronic thesis project. But the MA program also explores theoretical, critical, social, and ethical contexts for thinking about Digital Humanities research and applications, including issues of intellectual property, data and privacy, public access and preservation. 

For details about this program, see http://www.luc.edu/ctsdh/academics/maindigitalhumanities/.

MS Thesis Option
---------------------

Effective Fall 2013, MS students may elect the thesis option.

Students may choose to write a thesis in lieu of taking two classes (6 credits), although course work is strongly recommended over the thesis option, especially those not planning on a research-oriented career. Many students
pursuing the thesis option, therefore, would be considering a PhD program at another institution. 

Students wishing to do a thesis should discuss this option as early as possible with the Director of Graduate Programs. Regarding thesis procedures, see the Graduate School Catalog.

Pursuing Multiple MS Degrees
-------------------------------

We are often asked about whether it is possible to complete more than one MS degree (e.g. and MS in Computer Science
and an MS in Software Engineering). The answer is no, unless you complete 60 hours of study (30 hours of courses for
each degree). It is impractical and expensive, and we don't think it serves students well. Our goal is to prepare you
for a serious career (professional and/or academic) after completing *one* graduate degree.

Students who wish to continue taking courses may do so after completing their degree as non-degree students. We also
encourage our students to maintain connections through our professional and social networking groups. Many of our
students continue to be involved in research laboratories such as the Emerging Technologies Laboratory
(see http://www.etl.luc.edu).

Time and Residence Requirements
------------------------------------------

Normally it takes one to one-and-a-half years of full-time study to earn a MS in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Information Technology from Loyola. Students who attend part time must complete the program within five years. This period may be extended only by special action of the Dean of the Graduate School.


Application for Degree
------------------------------------------

It is the exclusive responsibility of all graduate students to inform the Graduate School office of their intention to graduate with an MA degree. Once you have determined when you will receive your degree (e.g., August, December or May), you must apply for graduation through LOCUS. The Graduate School sets the deadlines (typically December 1 for a May degree, February 1 for an August degree, and August 1 for a December degree). Check the academic calendar for the Graduate School available through the main page of the Loyola website. 

After completing the summer courses and passing the exams, you'll be certified for an August degree. Because we have only one ceremony per year when students "walk," however, August degree students walk in the May ceremony the following year.
