MS in Computer Science
----------------------------

The MS in Computer Science provides foundations of Computer Science, while
acknowledging that Computer Science is key to algorithms in the sciences.
Other programs in the Computer Science Department with different foci are the
MS in Software Engineering and the MS in Information Technology.

The program requires a total of ten courses (30 hours). 
Students can receive up to two courses of transfer credit 
for graduate work taken elsewhere, 
in accordance with the applicable rules of the Graduate School.

Many 400-level courses in the department have closely related 300-level analogues, 
e.g. Comp 443 and 343. Students who enter the MS program with a Loyola BS degree 
must choose to take 400-level courses that are not closely related to any 
300-level courses taken earlier.

Specifically with the MS in Computer Science, there is a :ref:`thesis_option`,
described in its own section.

Required Courses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following three courses are required by the program:

* Comp 417: Social, Ethical and Legal Issues in Computing
* Comp 413: Intermediate Object-Oriented Development
* Comp 460: Algorithms and Complexity

The Graduate Program Director may approve the replacement of 
Comp 413 by an additional course on the Restricted Electives list in cases 
where the student's primary program focus is not on software development.

Restricted Electives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
MS-CS students must also take three courses from the following list:

* Comp 433: Web Services Programming
* Comp 436: Markup Languages
* Comp 439: Distributed Systems
* Comp 442: Server-Side Software Development
* Comp 443: Computer Networks
* Comp 453: Database Programming
* Comp 464: High-Performance Computing
* Comp 471: Programming Languages
* Comp 473: Object-Oriented Programming
* Comp 474: Software Engineering

General Electives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rest of the required 30 credits are free electives taken from courses
at the level of 400 or above in COMP or CSIS.

MS-CS students may take up to a maximum of 6 hours of 
Comp 490: Independent Project and/or Comp 499: Internship.


.. index:: MS in Software Engineering

MS in Software Engineering
----------------------------

The MS in Software Engineering caters to students interested in software engineering 
and also other contemporary topics of long-term value to the industry. 
Most early careers in the industry are based on either software development 
or managerial aspects of software development. 
This degree places more weight on software development. 
For those seeking a greater focus on managerial aspects, 
we offer the M.S. in Information Technology (MS-IT) below.

For details about this program, see http://luc.edu/cs/academics/graduateprograms/msse/.

.. index::  MS in Information Technology

MS in Information Technology
------------------------------

The Master of Science in Information Technology is designed for current and 
aspiring professionals in charge of developing, implementing, operating, 
and managing information systems in a variety of organizations. 
Students in this program will gain a broad technical understanding 
of current and emerging technologies in the industry, 
a familiarity with systems engineering concepts, 
and a solid foundation in net-centric computing. 
They will also have a firm grasp of current and future effects of the 
convergence of the telecommunications, media, and information technology sectors.
Some of the courses can be taken online.

.. true? dumped for now
    All course work can be completed online, and the online program includes an 
    intensive on-site immersion as a capstone.

.. index:: MA in Digital Humanities

MA in Digital Humanities
-----------------------------

The Computer Science department is a partner in the MA in Digital Humanities program. 
While not a department-specific
program, we encourage students with interdisciplinary interests at the 
intersection of culture and technology to 
consider this degree, which allows one to elect courses from the CS department.

The Digital Humanities MA program at Loyola Unviersity's
Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities (CTSDH) combines 
theoretical and practical courses. 
Its aims are ultimately practical and professional, 
training new digital specialists for the growing knowledge and 
information economy and today's research in humanities disciplines. 
Because the nature of much Digital Humanities work is constructive and project-based, 
students in the M.A. program will be given hands-on training in workshop 
or seminar-based classes, training in text editing and text encoding, 
electronic publishing and platforms, programming, interface design, project management, 
and archive construction. At every stage, 
team-based collaborative learning will be encouraged, in class projects, 
for example, and potentially in the required electronic thesis project. 
But the MA program also explores theoretical, critical, social, 
and ethical contexts for thinking about Digital Humanities research and applications, 
including issues of intellectual property, data and privacy, public access and preservation. 

For details about this program, see http://www.luc.edu/ctsdh/academics/maindigitalhumanities/.

.. index:: thesis option

.. _thesis_option:

Thesis Option
---------------------

MS students in the Computer Science degree program may elect the MS thesis option.

Course work is strongly recommended over the thesis option, 
especially for those not planning on a research-oriented career. Many students
pursuing the thesis option, therefore, 
would be considering a PhD program at another institution. 

Students wishing to do a thesis should discuss this option as early as 
possible with the GPD. 

Theses may involve research in purely theoretical computer science 
(for example, development or analysis of algorithms), 
or may involve development of a software package, 
or may involve instrumentation, measurement and analysis of existing systems 
(for example, studying network performance). 
Because of this wide range, there is no one
formal course in research methods. 
Courses in the restricted-electives list above contain a significant 
component of area-specific integrated research-methods material. 
Students interested in writing a thesis are strongly urged to seek 
advising from the GPD or other faculty as early as possible as to which 
electives in this group will be the most appropriate for the student's 
proposed area of research.

Here is an outline of the steps toward your thesis.  The ones in boldface
are formal steps with documentation required by the Graduate School:

#.  If you wish to write a thesis, first identify a faculty advisor and 
    select a tentative topic or area of research. 
    The existing program allows you to take up to 6.0 hours of 
    Comp 490: Independent Study. 
    You will typically begin their research program in such a course, 
    though you may also identify an advisor and select a tentative topic 
    as part of a conventional classroom course.

#.  Thesis/Dissertation Committee Recommendation

    -  The next step is for you to secure permission to pursue the thesis 
       option from the Graduate Program Director. 
    -  The Graduate Program Director, in consultation with you and your 
       chosen advisor, recommends a thesis committee to the Graduate School. 
       The committee will consist of at least three faculty members; 
       normally the committee director will be the advisor.  
    -  **For the formal Graduate School process** 
       **you create the committee at the gsps link**
       https://gsps.luc.edu/. An email will then
       be sent to the director for approval and then the GPD.
    -  You will receives an email if your committee is formally approved by
       the Graduate School.

    At least 50% of the committee must be comprised of Loyola graduate
    faculty; the director of the committee must have full graduate faculty
    status – see
    http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/about\_facultystaff.shtml
    for the current list of full members.

#.  Once the committee is approved, you may continue with your 
    research in subsequent semesters registering for the 
    zero-credit-hour Comp 595: Thesis Supervision, if available, or  
    Comp 605: Masters Study, if Comp 595 is not listed.  If you still
    need credit hours and have not already had the full number of hours
    of Comp 490, you can register for that instead.
    Students may register for any number of semesters of Comp 595/605, 
    subject to time-to-degree-completion constraints.

#.  Once you have your thesis committee approved, 
    the thesis becomes a degree requirement. 
    (This is important for international students.) 
    You may, however, petition to revert back to non-thesis status; 
    this requires permission of the Graduate Program Director and the Graduate School. 
    At that point, you would be able to graduate without writing a thesis, 
    if the coursework requirements were met. 
    No reimbursement or credit will be received for any Comp 595, Comp 605, 
    or other thesis-specific courses taken.

#.  Ballot for the Approval of a Thesis/Dissertation Proposal

    -  You will then prepare a formal research proposal, 
       in consultation with your advisor.
       This proposal must be submitted to your committee for review.  
       This sequence is monitored through gsps.
    -  If you are submitting your proposal to the Institutional Review Board
       (IRB), you must have approval or exemption *before* the Graduate
       School approves your proposal. You do not need to submit proof,
       Graduate School will confirm. 
       (This step is required for the use of human and animal subjects,
       and is not common for Computer Science.)
    -  **A simple one to two paragraph abstract must be included**
       **in the proposal form on gsps.**
    -  You will get notified once all members of the committee, the GPD,
       and the Graduate School approve the proposal through gsps.
    -  You are now ready to "conduct research" for the project. 
  
#.  Ballot for Text and Oral Defense Form

    -  Upon completion of your thesis, you will be required to formally
       defend your research. Schedule this with your committee.
       You thesis should be in nearly final form.
    -  Typically you should give the committee three weeks to read the final
       draft of the thesis before the defense date.
    -  **For this requirement, you must download the defense ballot**
       http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/T%20&%20D%20defense%20ballot--DB.pdf
       and bring it with you to your defense. Your director and other
       committee member(s) will sign the ballot – this ballot then needs to
       go to the GPD for final approval. 
    -  The committee may require modifications before approving the thesis,
       or possibly reject it.
    -  Once approved, the GPD will upload
       the ballot in gsps for Graduate School approval. 
    -  You will be notified
       once the process is complete.
  

#.  Formatting the Thesis/Dissertation

    -   Every thesis/dissertation needs to be formatted according to the rules
        stated in the Graduate School's formatting manual
        http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/formatting.shtml.
    -   **Format check is a required step**; the deadlines, depending on the
        conferral date, are posted on the Key Dates and Deadlines page on the
        Graduate School website.  These deadlines are well before the end of the
        semester - be sure to check and satisfy them.
    -   **Final Copy, both electronic and hard copies also have deadlines**,
        depending on the conferral date.


Pursuing Multiple MS Degrees
-------------------------------

We are often asked about whether it is possible to complete more than one MS degree 
(e.g. and MS in Computer Science and an MS in Software Engineering). 
The answer is no, unless you complete 60 hours of study (30 hours of courses for
each degree). It is impractical and expensive, and we don't think it serves students well. 
Our goal is to prepare you
for a serious career (professional and/or academic) after completing *one* graduate degree.

Students who wish to continue taking courses may do so after completing their degree 
as non-degree students. We also
encourage our students to maintain connections through our professional 
and social networking groups. Many of our
students continue to be involved in research laboratories such as the 
Emerging Technologies Laboratory
(see http://www.etl.luc.edu).

.. index:: time for program

Time and Residence Requirements
------------------------------------------

Normally it takes one to one-and-a-half years of full-time study to earn a 
MS in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Information Technology from Loyola. 
Students who attend part time must complete the program within five years. 
This period may be extended only by special action of the Dean of the Graduate School.
