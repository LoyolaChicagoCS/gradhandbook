Regulations and Procedures
================================

.. index:: course loads
   full-time

Course Loads
--------------------------------

A full-time student will usually carry three courses per semester. Course
loads for part-time students are worked out on an individual basis. 

We do not encourage students to take more than 3 courses a term, and you should
contact the Graduate Program Director if you need to take more than 3 courses in
a term for any reason. It is explicitly prohibited to enroll in more than 3 
courses to hold a space in a course. Many of our courses fill up quickly, so you
should only register for courses that you truly plan to complete.  No one is 
allowed to take more than 12 credit hours in Fall or Spring.

We encourage you to consider taking summer or online courses if you need to 
complete your degree more quickly.

.. index:: registration

Registration
--------------------------------

Both new and continuing students must complete the process of registration
before every semester in which they are either attending classes or writing
a thesis (applicable only to MS Computer Science students opting to
complete a thesis). A schedule of courses for the upcoming term is available a
few months before classes are scheduled to begin. We also maintain a long-
term schedule. See http://www.luc.edu/cs/schedules/.

Newly admitted students should first consult with the
Graduate Program Director before registering for courses. A discussion with the
GPD is particularly important if there is any question of a student's prerequisite
preparation.

Before the next registration period, you should be provided an individual faculty 
advisor for the rest of your studies.  Later registration choices should be taken up
with your advisor.

Students must maintain continual registration
throughout their years in the program unless they explicitly apply for and
are approved for a :ref:`leave_of_absence`.  
You must also announce your decision to come back
from a Leave of Absence with an email to the Associate Dean of the Graduate School.
Only after the Graduate School accepts your letter announcing your plan to return, 
will you be allowed to register for classes.
    
After registration opens you can register yourself through LOCUS for most
courses with just your student ID number.  
*New students should get course advising first from the department*, 
and all others are welcomed to get
advising. 

*You cannot register yourself for Comp 490 or 499* as both require
permission of the GPD or instructor of record. See sections
:ref:`independent_study` and :ref:`internships`.  Other courses that can
have complications registering and dropping are the CSIS courses, depending on
when you want to register for or drop a course.  See :ref:`CSIS_courses`.
below.

In any course where there is a note about consent or permission required, you must 
make a direct emailed request to the department, clearly stating the course and semester, 
and number of credits if that is variable. If you are asking for a course that requires
permisison of the instructor, please add your direct request to an approving email 
that you forward from the instructor.
 
The department then gives consent and does your registration administratively.

It is in your best interest to register early, to get into sections you want
and have ample time to detect and clear up any possible registration block
that may have been placed.  Common examples are an immunization block, 
a conditional admission block, or a bursar block.  
Students have been given late fees or had a lot of trouble due
to delay from such blocks.  One
misleading feature in LOCUS is that all MS students have a Dean's time limit
block, but it does not activate until you have been an MS student for five
years - do not worry about that one.
*You are strongly encouraged to check in Locus weeks before registration opens,*
*to see if a block appears*, and get it addressed so it will not delay your 
registration.

.. index:: independent study Comp 490
   Comp 490 independent study

.. _independent_study:

Independent Study
--------------------------------

If you are doing an independent project for Comp 490, you need to find a
faculty member to supervise your project and have the faculty supervisor
email the department secretary to register you. This does not generally make
sense in your first semester but is possible in exceptional circumstances.
It helps if you and the faculty member are familiar with each other.
Talk to your instructors outside of class, and 
take advantage of community events to meet and get to know faculty!
It is particularly helpful when you want to do something that the professor 
already wants done.  At the other end of the spectrum, 
a student might just propose something that sounds interesting 
to a potential faculty supervisor who knows the student is self-motivated.  
Or a project could end up somewhere in between: something the professor is 
interested in, with a particular twist that appeals to the student....

The typical approach is for the student to meet with the faculty member 
and then confirm the details of the
agreement in an email to the faculty supervisor, being sure to include
the exact *semester and credit hours* that your have agreed on. The
supervisor then forwards the email with his or her approval to the
*graduate secretary*, so she can register you. Your agreement does *not* go 
to the GPD.

These courses are for 1-6 credits. See the
section below on variable hour courses. We rarely allow students to 
take more than 6 total credits in their overall program
for the sum of Independent Study and 
Internships, but 
do allow further high-level independent study in exceptional circumstances.

In most cases, we recommend that you and your independent study advisor
fill out a *request for course title form*, which is available at 
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Request%20for%20Course%20Title.pdf
The Graduate
Program Director must sign this form.  This is very useful when someone else
is reading your transcript: Plain "Independent Study" on your transcript
is totally uninformative!



.. index:: internships Comp 499
   Comp 499 Internship

.. _internships:

Internships (COMP 499)
-----------------------------------------------

First, you need to find or hold job during the period of the Internship. 
There are online, searchable listings through the university career center,
`http://www.luc.edu/career <http://www.luc.edu/career>`_. (The Computer
Science department also maintains an *informal* jobs list at 
http://jobs.cs.luc.edu.)  When you find a
job, contact the GPD and get your job description approved.  
Internships are for 1-6 credits.  See
:ref:`variable_credit_courses`.  
   
Download, *read*, print, fill out *both pages*, and return the 
`MOU Form <https://luc.box.com/CS-Grad-Internship-MOU>`_.  
Please read this carefully before asking questions of the GPD.
It contains a description of the details of your academic requirements 
for the course.  
You will also need your job supervisor's signature.  Get the
finished form to the GPD, so we can register you for the course for the proper 
number of credits.  
The form can be scanned and emailed or turn in paper to the
department staff.  If you are doing :ref:`cpt`, 
turn in the CPT form at the same time.

There are three related but different terms: **job**, **internship**,
and **CPT**, :ref:`cpt`. You can have a job and
not have it be an internship for academic credit, or you can have a job
that goes on longer than an internship. Also if you are doing an
academic internship, your job employer does not need to classify your
position as "internship". If you are doing an academic internship, the
`MOU <https://luc.box.com/CS-Grad-Internship-MOU>`_
indicates only two small requirements for your employer during your
time in the academic internship: The bulk of your duties must be
related to doing computer science in the real world, and the supervisor
will write a few line email at the end of the time of the academic
internship indicating your successful completion of all the hours
required for the academic internship.

**Service Internships**:  Though most students choose a well-paid internship,
some choose an *unpaid* internship for a worthy, nonprofit cause.  
In this case the tuition for the internship can be a burden.  Contact
the GPD about whether your service may be such that the Dean would agree to
waive tuition.  If possible, this should be clarified well in advance.

.. index:: curricular practical training (CPT)

.. _cpt:

Curricular Practical Training (For F-1 students)
-----------------------------------------------------------

You should consult with the 
`Office for International Programs(OIP) <http://www.luc.edu/oip>`_ 
for the full legal details of CPT.

Here are a few of the important points.  If you get a job on campus,
like the considerable number of students who have worked for Loyola's
Information Services, you do not need to be doing CPT and no CPT
restrictions apply.  If you want to work off campus for pay, then you
need to be doing CPT, and there are a number of requirements.

First of all, you need to have been a full-time F-1 student anywhere in
the United States for two semesters.  If you want to count a summer (as
students starting in Spring or Summer are likely to want), there is a
confusing point:  The number of credits needed to be full-time to count as
leading up to CPT are different than the number of credits a student
starting in summer needs to be in full-time status!  Be sure to check
with the OIP for the exact current details.

To start CPT you must get an application submitted,
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/iss/pdfs/Curricular%20Practical%20Training.pdf
in one of two routes.  In both cases with the CPT application
you should provide a written job offer 
(which can be an email) from the  prospective employer.
The completed CPT application must be delivered to the International Office, and
they will issue the work permit.

The CPT can be tied to an academic course in either of two ways. You 
get a signature on the CPT application differently in the two cases:

* You can take the Comp 499 course specifically for :ref:`internships`,
  with the regular tuition charge per credit.  Get the form with
  your MOU and job offer to the GPD, and the 
  GPD will get the application 
  completed and forwarded to the OIP with the job offer.
* For no extra
  tuition you are likely to be able to tie it to a course you are
  already planning to take. There is a section of the CPT application for this.
  You can get the *signature on the CPT form of an instructor* to pair the
  internship with a course in the same semester, *or for a fall course*
  and an internship in the *previous summer*.  
  Show the instructor the offer letter. 
  If you do the no-extra-tuition option,
  you are able to work but you *get no further credit toward graduation*,
  and the course instructor is responsible for determining any extra
  reporting or work you do to tie the internship to the instructor's
  course.  *You may need to send the CPT form and job offer to the OIP yourself.*


.. index:: variable credit courses
.. _variable_credit_courses:

Variable Credit Courses
-----------------------------------------------------------

Comp 490 and 499 are for 1-6 credits. Up to 6 credits total can be counted
toward graduation, counting all the times you register for these two
courses. (In practice that usually means 3 or 6 credits since all other courses
are 3 credits.) You do not need to take a multiple of three credits at a
time. What matters is the total, when it is time to graduate. 

.. index:: CSIS courses
   Business School
   GSB
   quarter courses
   Winter Quarter
   Changing CSIS courses

.. _CSIS_courses:

CSIS Courses
-----------------------------------------------------------

CSIS courses are special sections set up to give you credit in the
Computer Science MS program for courses offered by the Graduate School
of Business.  They broaden the Computer Science offerings and let you
essentially take GSB courses at the Graduate School's much lower tuition
rate.  There are a number of special considerations coming from the fact
that GSB courses are *quarter* courses.  They have the same holidays as in
The Graduate School semester system, but exam times or term start times
or both are different.  The main administrative issue is that this
confuses LOCUS, the school online administration system.  Fall Quarter
starts with Fall semester, but ends in November.  Winter Quarter goes
from November into February, spanning parts of both Fall and Spring
Semesters.  A fairly arbitrary decision was made to list Winter Quarter
CSIS courses under Fall semester in LOCUS.  Spring Quarter Courses do not start
until February. 

Because Winter Quarter spans two semesters, it is very important to look
at the Spring Semester schedule for COMP courses before registering for
a Winter Quarter course.  Registration for a Winter Quarter course will
make it impossible for you to register for a Spring Semester COMP course
on the same night.  Even if you check an early Spring Semester schedule
before signing up for a Winter Quarter course, you run the risk of
a later change to the Spring semester schedule creating a conflict.
We make ever effort to keep the spring semester schedule stable, but 
unexpected things can always come up.

LOCUS lists CSIS courses as semester courses, so if you look at your
current course list in October, you will see both Fall and Winter
Quarter courses included!  *You* have to know the *real* calendar.

Particular issues arise with registering for and dropping CSIS courses
outside the times LOCUS is expecting.  If you register and add or drop
in the regular semester time limits (much earlier than the time Winter
and Spring quarter courses actually start), then you should be able to
do your registration changes by yourself, online, in LOCUS, with no
problem.  Please do that where possible.  On the other hand, 
**if you want to make changes closer to the time Winter and Spring Quarter**
**courses actually start**, you should make all registraion requests
through the GPD, gpd@cs.luc.edu.  Since the department ends up making
registration changes which are very important to you, we need explicit
directions and you need to indicate clear knowledge of the ramifications
of your choices.  Include the following in your email:

**Registration request** to gpd@cs.luc.edu after the normal LOCUS
semester registration time limit and before the GSB registeration time
limit for Winter or Spring: 

#. Include a direct request like "Please register me for CSIS XXX
   Section YYY for ZZZ Quarter." *not* an indirect question like "Would
   it be OK if I register for....?"
#. Include your full name and Student ID number.
#. Explicitly acknowledge the drop deadlines and the timeframe and
   manner you must notify us to get you dropped (as further discussed
   below).   You could include something like "I know I must email you
   with an explicit request to drop the course by XX/XX/XXXX if I want
   no trace left for the course and by YY/YY/YYYY to avoid tuition, but
   still get a W on my transcript."  The dates are publicized at the
   `Bursar's web site <http://www.luc.edu/bursar/withdraw_schedule.shtml#gsb>`_. 
   We will try to include them also on our course web pages for Winter
   and Spring Quarters.
#. It is also possible to request a swap for an already running course 
   that will overlap the later starting course, if you got access to a
   CSIS course opening after the normal drop deadline.  
   Of course in this case your email needs to 
   also clearly state the course you wish to swap out of.

**Drop requests** after the normal LOCUS semester drop/add time limit,
but inside the limits set by the Graduate School of Business:

#. Within the limits set by the GSB, make the drop in Locus.  This will
   drop you and note the time of your decision.
#. Email gpd@cs.luc.edu and explain when you dropped what exact course,
   and ask us to backdate the withdrawal to make up for LOCUS's
   incorrect understanding of dates.
#. Include your full name and Student ID number.

The time of dropping the course is crucial in determining its effect. 
Be aware of the GSB deadlines for getting the course dropped with no
trace and the later deadline for avoiding  tuition.  We will be correct
things if you are before the GSB deadlines.  See below under Dropping a
Course for further discussion of the categories. 

F-1 visa students  
    If you are keeping 3 real Fall semester courses, 
    and you add a winter quarter course, 
    it can be counted for visa purposes as one of the 3 courses that you need 
    for full-time status in spring.  
    Check with the Office of International Programs for details.

.. index:: graduation
   deadline; for applying for graduation

Graduation
-----------------------------------------------------------

Degrees are conferred in May, August, and December.  You must apply
for graduation **way in advance** of graduation or the official conferral
of your degree will be **postponed**. I will not be able to appeal
this for you.  Note that there are only graduation *ceremonies* in May.

**Deadlines**: December 1 for Spring, February 1 for Summer graduation, August 1 for
Fall graduation.  
See the discussion of ceremonies below if you want to
participate in a graduation ceremony and you graduate in Summer or Fall.

**Procedure**:

Go into Locus and submit your application for graduation *by the deadline*.  That
is all you need to do if you are on time.  
There is no penalty for guessing wrong about when you will graduate, but you will need
to apply again for the actual time.

You can apply  up to 15 days later, 
*with a penalty fee* and *walking a piece of paper around*:  see
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/LATE%20Application%20to%20Receive%20a%20Degree.pdf
In case the URL changes, it should be listed on the Graduate School Forms page under 
Late Application for Graduation.

If your last course is a CSIS course in Winter Quarter, register
for Spring graduation, even though Winter Quarter courses are listed under Fall
semester in LOCUS.  Of course you will not really graduate until after
Winter Quarter courses end in February.

**Graduation Ceremonies are only in May**:  If you have only *one* course left
for summer, you can ask to participate in the *previous* May
graduation.  This one course can be 490/499 for more than 3 credits.
To do this you must apply by the deadline listed above and
promptly email the GPD, asking for approval to walk in the May
ceremony.  If you graduate in the Summer or Fall, you can choose to
return to participate in the *following* May graduation ceremony
(unless you already participated in the previous May graduation, as
discussed above).

.. index:: leave of absence
   reinstatement form

.. _leave_of_absence:

Leave of Absence
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once you start graduate school, the default assumption is that you will be
enrolled each fall and spring until you sign up for graduation and
graduate. If you need to interrupt your studies before that, the Graduate
School requires that you apply for a leave of
absence through the gsps system, under student forms in
https://gsps.luc.edu/. 

After being approved for a leave, you
will need
to notify the Associate Dean of the Graduate School of your intent
to enroll before you can register for
classes and resume study. See the address under :ref:`graduate-school-offices`.

If you *neglect to request a Leave*, 
the return process is longer and less sure:  
You need to fill out the **Reinstatement** form,
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Reinstatement%20Request.pdf,
and return it to the GPD (preferably as an emailed electronic scan).

.. note::
   Besides the reinstatement form itself being filled out you need to 
   return a document with two other parts:
   
   * The reason for your absence.  (The form says reason for reinstatement -
     but it means reason for absence.)
   * Timeline to graduation:  When you plan to be back and when you plan
     to finish.

.. _droppping_a_course:

Dropping a Course, Avoiding Extra Bills
-----------------------------------------------------------

You should always be able to withdraw yourself from the course in LOCUS,
no matter how you got registered for a course: by yourself in LOCUS, by
a request to the department staff, or off of a waiting list. If you
are sure you want to withdraw from a course, do not waste time emailing
the department for help, just do it yourself. The date that the
withdrawal is entered into LOCUS affects whether you get a W on your
transcript, and whether tuition is still due. Different dates apply.
Be sure to look at the Academic Calendar for the given semester. Once
you are registered, merely not attending class does **NOT** extend these
dates.

-  Withdrawal with no trace: Generally by the end of the first week of
   Fall and Spring semesters. Generally only through the first Tuesday
   of the semester for Summer session. 
-  Withdrawal with only a W on the transcript, and no tuition due:
   Generally during the second week of Fall and Spring semesters.
   Sometime during the first week in summer sessions. Be sure to check
   the Academic Calendar at http://www.luc.edu/academics/schedules/.  
   A W has no academic consequences.  It is just
   a historical record of you changing your mind.
-  Withdrawal later during classes: W on the transcript and a partial
   or complete tuition penalty. Do not get yourself into this situation
   just by not paying attention!
 
The categories are the same for CSIS courses, but the procedures can be
more complicated.  See the section on CSIS Courses above.

.. index:: changing MS programs

Changing your chosen MS Program
-----------------------------------------------------------

It is easy to switch between our MS degree programs in the department. 
Through the gsps system under student forms in
https://gsps.luc.edu/, find Change in Degree Seeking.  You will need to
include a statement about why you want to change the program.

.. index:: transfer of credit

Transfer of Credit into the Loyola MS Program from Earlier Graduate Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

During your *first* semester, you can apply to transfer up to 6 credits of
previous *graduate* work relevant to your current program. 
Do not delay!  Your official
transcripts need to show B or better in relevant courses. 
For conditionally admitted students, Loyola must already have the relevant
official transcript. International students, see :ref:`international_transfer`.
In the unusual case where the transcript is only available after admission,
get your *official* transcript to the GPD.  
Although official transcripts are needed to forward the request to the
Grad School for final approval, you are welcomed to show unofficial
transcripts to the GPD to see if you have appropriate courses.

.. index:: international transfer credit

.. _international_transfer:

Further International Transcript Credit Transfer Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------
   
International transcripts need only a *general* evaluation by ECE,
http://www.ece.org/, or
Educational Perspectives, http://www.educational-perspectives.org/,
for *admission*, but they need a *course by course* evaluation to
*transfer* international graduate credit. It is most economical to ask
for the course by course evaluation the first time transcripts are
submitted to an evaluator, if you are expecting to get transfer credit.

Note:  All courses, including graduate courses in your first 4 years 
since the start of college, are considered part of your undergraduate education.
Only if you do MS work *past* the four years of academic work can 
transfer credit be considered.

located here: http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml.

.. broken link?
    link on page for gradcatalog is broken; linked next best thing above.

Graduate students in the Computer Science Department are expected to maintain an average 
of not less than B (3.0) during their course of study.
Those who fail to meet this requirement may be 
dismissed by the Graduate School. 
No more than two grades below B and no grades of C- or less
may be counted as fulfilling degree requirements.
*Still C-, D or F  do count to enormously drag down your cumulative GPA*.

.. index:: incomplete grade I

Incomplete Grade
--------------------------------

Faculty may assign the grade of I to a student who has not completed the assigned 
work by the end of the term. This grade is not assigned automatically; 
rather, it is up to the student to work out with the instructor a plan, 
including a deadline, for completing the work for the course. 

Under the Graduate School regulations, a student has one semester to complete the course
(and summer counts as a semester!). 
If the student does not turn in the work by the deadline, 
the I grade will automatically become an F.  
Please read the new policy on the Graduate School web page at 
http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml#grades1.

Although it is not uncommon for graduate students to take an occasional Incomplete, 
it is of course better not to take an incomplete when possible. 
Making up an incomplete course often proves harder than students expect, 
particularly if much time has elapsed since the end of the course. 
In any case, faculty members have various policies regarding Incompletes, 
so it is advisable to discuss the matter with your instructor as early as possible 
if you anticipate the need for an Incomplete. 

.. index:: academic honesty
   cheating
   plagiarism

Academic Honesty
--------------------------------

Although academic dishonesty can take many forms, in our field it manifests 
primarily as plagiarism of text or source code. 
The Graduate School Catalog defines plagiarism as "the appropriation for gain of ideas, 
language or work of another without sufficient public acknowledgement that the material 
is not one's own."  As a graduate student, you very likely have a good understanding 
of the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not. 
If you are ever uncertain, it is of course best to consult the 
GPD or another faculty member.

The penalty for an instance of plagiarism is, at a minimum, failure on the assignment,
which may well be tantamount to failure in the course. 
A serious breach or a pattern of dishonesty can lead to expulsion from Loyola. 
Although quite rare in our department, cases have occurred in the past and have 
resulted in dismissal.

.. index:: grievance procedure

Grievance Procedure
----------------------------------

Students, faculty, and administrators are strongly encouraged to resolve any problems 
they encounter in the academic process through informal discussion. 
If you are unable to resolve a problem with a member of the staff or faculty, 
or if you wish to lodge a formal complaint, you should first meet to discuss the matter 
with the GPD. If the problem cannot be satisfactorily 
resolved by the GPD, it will be taken up by the Department Chair. 
Violations of the University's ethical standards not resolvable within the Department 
may call for the use of the Graduate School's grievance procedure. 
Students wishing to initiate a grievance must do so in writing to the Dean. 
Further information can be obtained from the Graduate School office.
