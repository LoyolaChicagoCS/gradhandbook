Regulations and Procedures
================================

   full-time

Course Loads
--------------------------------

A full-time student will usually carry three courses per semester. Course
loads for part-time students are worked out on an individual basis. 

.. FIX ??
    All
    students funded by the Department or the Graduate School are considered full
    time and should be enrolled in 3 courses (this includes part-time graduate 
    assistants who are expected to be full-time students unless agreed upon
    with the GPD).

We do not encourage students to take more than 3 courses a term, and you should
contact the Graduate Program Director if you need to take more than 3 courses in
a term for any reason. It is explicitly prohibited to enroll in more than 3 
courses to hold a space in a course. Many of our courses fill up quickly, so you
should only register for a course that you truly plan to complete.  No one is 
allowed to take more than 12 credit hours in Fall or Spring.

We encourage you to consider taking summer or online courses if you need to 
complete your degree more quickly.

.. index:: registration

Registration
--------------------------------

Both new and continuing students must complete the process of registration
before every semester in which they are either attending classes or writing
their thesis (applicable only to MS Computer Science students opting to
complete a thesis). A schedule of courses for the upcoming term is available a
few months before classes are scheduled to begin. We also maintain a long-
term schedule.


.. FIX
    In order to register for graduate courses newly admitted students 
    must first consult with the
    Graduate Program Director. 

    Once your selections are approved, they will be
    entered into the system by the Graduate Program Secretary, completing the
    registration process. It is your responsibility to check LOCUS to verify your
    registration each semester. 

Students must maintain continual registration
throughout their years in the program unless they explicitly apply for and
are approved for a :ref:`leave_of_absence`.  
You must also announce your decision to come back
from a Leave of Absence with an email to the Associate Dean of the Graduate School.

.. FIX ?? phd only?
    or risk having to apply for
    reinstatement and pay both a penalty and back fees.
    
After registration opens you can register yourself through LOCUS for most
courses with just your student ID number.  
*New students should get course advising first from the department*, 
and all others are welcomed to get
advising.  You cannot register yourself for Comp 490 or 499 as both require
permission of the GPD or instructor of record. See sections
:ref:`independent_study` and :ref:`internships`.  Other courses that can
have complications registering and dropping are the CSIS courses, depending on
when you want to register or drop a course.  See :ref:`CSIS_courses`.
below.

In any course where there is a note about consent or permission required, you must 
make a direct emailed request to the department, clearly stating the course and semester, 
and number of credits if that is variable.  
The department then gives consent and does your registration administratively.

It is in your best interest to register early, to get into sections you want
and have ample time to detect and clear up any possible registration block
that may have been placed.  Common examples are an immunization block or a
bursar block.  Students have been given late fees or had a lot of trouble due
to delay from such blocks.  Deal with these and clear them out early.  One
misleading feature in LOCUS is that all MS students have a Dean's time limit
block, but it does not activate until you have been an MS student for five
years - do not worry about that one.

.. index:: independent study Comp 490
   Comp 490 independent study

.. _independent_study:

Independent Study
--------------------------------

If you are doing an independent project for Comp 490, you need to find a
faculty member to supervise your project and have the faculty supervisor
email let the department secretary to register you. This does not generally make
sense in your first semester but is possible in exceptional circumstances.
It helps if you and the faculty member are familiar with each other.

The typical approach is for the student to confirm the details of the
agreement in an email to the faculty supervisor, being sure to include
the exact course, semester and credit hours your have agreed on.  The
supervisor then forwards the email with his or her approval to the
department administration.  These courses are for 1-6 credits.  See the
section below on variable hour courses. We rarely allow students to 
take more than 6 total credits of Independent Study (+ Internships) but, 
again, allow it in exceptional circumstances.

In most cases, we recommend that you and your independent study advisor
fill out a request for course title form, which is available at 
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Request%20for%20Course%20Title.pdf
The Graduate
Program Director must sign this form.  This is very useful when someone else
is reading your transcript.

.. index:: internships Comp 499
   Comp 499 Internship

.. _internships:

Internships
-----------------------------------------------

First, you need to find or hold job during the period of the Internship. 
There are online, searchable listings through the university career center,
`http://www.luc.edu/career <http://www.luc.edu/career>`_. (The Computer
Science department also maintains an *informal* jobs list at 
http://jobs.cs.luc.edu.)  When you find a
job, contact the GPD and get your job description approved.  Communicate
the number of credits desired and the semester in an email so we have a
record, and we can register you.  Internships are for 1-6 credits.  See
:ref:`variable_credit_courses`.  
   
Separately download, print, and fill out the 
`MOU Form <https://luc.box.com/s/hvc5ix6wel50g4z2z53v>`_.  
You will also need your job supervisor's signature.  Get the
finished form to the GPD, so we can register you for the course.  
The form can be scanned and emailed or turn in paper to the
department staff.

There are three related but different terms:  **job**, **internship**,
and **CPT**, :ref:`cpt`.  You can have a job and
not have it be an internship for academic credit, or you can have a job
that goes on longer than an internship.  Also if you are doing an
academic internship, your job employer does not need to classify your
position as "internship". If you are doing an academic internship, the
`MOU <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/CS-Grad-Internship-MOU.pdf>`_
indicates only two small requirements for your employer during your
time in the academic internship:  The bulk of your duties must be
related to doing computer science in the real world, and the supervisor
will write a few line email a the end of the time for the academic
internship indicating your successful completion of all the hours
required for the academic internship.

.. index:: curricular practical training (CPT)

.. _cpt:

Curricular Practical Training (For F-1 students)
-----------------------------------------------------------

You should consult with the `International
Center <http://www.luc.edu/oip>`_ for the full legal details of CPT.
 Here are a few of the important points.  If you get a job on campus,
like the considerable number of students who have worked for Loyola's
Information Services, you do not need to be doing CPT and no CPT
restrictions apply.  If you want to work off campus for pay, then you
need to be doing CPT, and there are a number of requirements.


First of all, you need to have been a full-time F-1 student anywhere in
the United States for two semesters.  If you want to count a summer (as
students starting in Spring or Summer are likely to want), there is a
confusing point:  The number of credits needed to be full-time to count as
leading up to CPT are different than the number of credits a student
starting in summer needs to be in full-time status!  Be sure to check
with the International Office for the exact current details.

The procedure to start CPT:

#. You must submit a CPT application with the Graduate Secretary and
   include a written job offer (which can be an email) from the
   prospective employer.   The form is on the OIP website,
   http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/iss/pdfs/Curricular%20Practical%20Training.pdf.  The
   CPT application must be delivered to the International Office, and
   they will issue the work permit.
#. The CPT can either be tied to a Comp 499 course OR for no extra
   tuition you are likely to be able to tie it to a course you are
   already planning to take:  There is a form on the International
   Office site for getting the approval of an instructor to pair the
   internship with a course in the same semester, or for a fall course
   and an internship in the previous summer.  The form indicates you
   also need the GPD's approval.  In you do the no-extra-tuition option,
   you are able to work but you get no further credit toward graduation,
   and the course instructor is responsible for determining any extra
   reporting or work you do to tie the internship to the instructor's
   course.

.. index:: variable credit courses
.. _variable_credit_courses:

Variable Credit Courses
-----------------------------------------------------------

Comp 490 and 499 are for 1-6 credits.  Up to 6 credits total can be counted
toward graduation, counting all the times you register for these two
courses.  In practice that means 3 or 6 credits since all other courses
are 3 credits.  You do not need to take a multiple of three credits at a
time.  What matters is the total, when it is time to graduate.  

.. old ??
    International students on F-1 visas:  This is particularly useful for
    you, who need to be registered for off-campus internships and who need 8
    credits, not 9, to be considered full time in fall and spring.  Examples:
     You can do a 1-credit internship/CPT in the summer and do a 2-credit
    independent study in another semester.  If you want to extend your work
    time at the end of your studies and would normally graduate in the
    spring, you could do two 2-credit independent studies earlier, leaving 2
    credits needed in the final summer and do a 1 credit CPT in first summer
    session, so you can start summer work as soon as possible in the summer,
    and do another 1 credit CPT in the second summer session, delaying
    completion, so post-graduation OPT does not need to start until after
    the second summer session.

   Changing CSIS courses

.. _CSIS_courses:

CSIS Courses
-----------------------------------------------------------

CSIS courses are special sections set up to give you credit in the
Computer Science MS program for courses offered by the Graduate School
of Business.  They broaden the Computer Science offerings and let you
essentially take GSB courses at the Graduate School's much lower tuition
rate.  There are a number of special considerations coming from the fact
that GSB courses are quarter courses.  They have the same holidays as in
The Graduate School semester system, but exam times or term start times
or both are different.   The main administrative issue is that this
confuses LOCUS, the school online administration system.  Fall Quarter
starts with Fall semester, but ends in November.  Winter Quarter goes
from November into February, spanning parts of both Fall and Spring
Semesters.  A fairly arbitrary decision was made to list Winter Quarter
CSIS courses under Fall semester.  Spring Quarter Courses do not start
until February.  

Because Winter Quarter spans two semesters, it is very important to look
at the Spring Semester schedule for COMP courses before registering for
a Winter Quarter course.  Registration for a Winter Quarter course will
make it impossible for you to register for a Spring Semester COMP course
on the same night.

LOCUS lists CSIS courses as semester courses, so if you look at your
current course list in October, you will see both Fall and Winter
Quarter courses included!  *You* have to know the *real* calendar. 
Particular issues arise with registering for and dropping CSIS courses
outside the times LOCUS is expecting.  If you register and add or drop
in the regular semester time limits (much earlier than the time Winter
and Spring quarter courses actually start), then you should be able to
do your registration changes by yourself, online, in LOCUS, with no
problem.  Please do that where possible.  On the other hand, 
**if you want to make changes closer to the time Winter and Spring Quarter**
**courses actually start**, you should make all registraion requests
through the GPD, gpd@cs.luc.edu.  Since the department ends up making
registration changes which are very important to you, we need explicit
directions and you need to indicate clear knowledge of the ramifications
of your choices.  Include the following in your email:

**Registration request** to gpd@cs.luc.edu after the normal LOCUS
semester registration time limit and before the GSB registeration time
limit for Winter or Spring: 

#. Include a direct request like "Please register me for CSIS XXX
   Section YYY for ZZZ Quarter." *not* an indirect question like "Would
   it be OK if I register for....?"
#. Include your full name and Student ID number.
#. Explicitly acknowledge the drop deadlines and the timeframe and
   manner you must notify us to get you dropped (as further discussed
   below).   You could include something like "I know I must email you
   with an explicit request to drop the course by XX/XX/XXXX if I want
   no trace left fo the course and by YY/YY/YYYY to avoid tuition, but
   still get a W on my transcript."  The dates are publicized at the
   `GSB web site <http://www.luc.edu/quinlan/mba/mba-chicago/index.shtml>`_. 
   We will try to include them also on our course web pages for Winter
   and Spring Quarters.

**Drop requests** after the normal LOCUS semester drop/add time limit,
but inside the limits set by the Graduate School of Business:

#. Within the limits set by the GSB, make the drop in Locus.  This will
   drop you and note the time of your decision.
#. Email gpd@cs.luc.edu and explain when you dropped what exact course,
   and ask us to backdate the withdrawal to make up for LOCUS's
   incorrect understanding of dates.
#. Include your full name and Student ID number.

The time of dropping the course is crucial in determining its effect. 
Be aware of the GSB deadlines for getting the course dropped with no
trace and the later deadline for avoiding  tuition.  We will be correct
things if you are before the GSB deadlines.  See below under Dropping a
Course for further discussion of the categories. 

.. index:: graduation

Graduation
-----------------------------------------------------------

Degrees are conferred in May, August, and December.  You must do
paperwork **way in advance** of graduation or the official conferral
of your degree will be **postponed**.  I will not be able to appeal
this for you.  Note that there are only graduation *ceremonies* in May.

**Deadlines**:   December 1 for Spring/Summer graduation, August 1 for
Fall graduation.  See the discussion of ceremonies below if you want to
participate in a graduation ceremony and you graduate in Summer or Fall.

.. FIX ?? 
   still this kludgy?

**Procedure**:

Go into Locus and submit your application for graduation *by the deadline*.  That
is all you need to do if you are on time.  
There is no penalty for guessing wrong about when you will graduate, but you will need
to apply again for the actual time.

You can apply  up to 15 days later, 
*with a penalty fee* and *walking a piece of paper around*:  see
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/LATE%20Application%20to%20Receive%20a%20Degree.pdf
In case the URL changes, it should be listed on the Graduate School Forms page under 
Late Application for Graduation.

If your last course is a CSIS course in Winter Quarter, still register
for Fall graduation, since Winter Quarter courses are listed under Fall
semester in LOCUS.  Of course you will not really graduate until after
Winter Quarter courses end in February.

**Graduation Ceremonies only in May**:  If you have only *one* course left
for summer, you can ask to participate in the *previous* May
graduation.  This one course can be 390/398 for more than 3 credits.
To do you must apply by the deadline listed above and
promptly email the GPD, asking for approval to walk in the May
ceremony.  If you graduate in the Summer or Fall, you can choose to
return to participate in the *following* May graduation ceremony
(unless you already participated in the previous May graduation, as
discussed above).

.. index:: leave of absence

.. _leave_of_absence:

Leave of Absence
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once you start grad school, the default assumption is that you will be
enrolled each fall and spring until you sign up for graduation and
graduate.  If you need to interrupt your studies before that, we ask
that you apply for a leave of
absence through the gsps system, under student forms in
https://gsps.luc.edu/. 

.. what true now?
    There is no direct penalty for forgetting notification, but it helps
    the department to know what is going on.  

    Whether or not you file a Leave of Absence form, you 

You
will need
to notify the Associate Dean of the Graduate School before you can register for
classes and resume study.

.. droppping_a_course:

Dropping a Course, Avoiding Extra Bills
-----------------------------------------------------------

You should always be able to withdraw yourself from the course in LOCUS,
no matter how you got registered for a course: by yourself in LOCUS, by
a request to the department staff, or off of a waiting list, .  If you
are sure you want to withdraw from a course, do not waste time emailing
the department for help, just do it yourself.  The date that the
withdrawal is entered into LOCUS affects whether you get a W on your
transcript, and whether tuition is still due.  Different dates apply.
Be sure to look at the Academic Calendar for the given semester.  Once
you are registered, merely not attending class does **NOT** extend these
dates.

-  Withdrawal with no trace:  Generally by the end of the first week of
   Fall and Spring semesters.  Generally only through the first Tuesday
   of the semester for Summer session.  
-  Withdrawal with only a W on the transcript, and no tuition due:
   Generally during the second week of Fall and Spring semesters.
   Sometime during the first week in summer sessions.  Be sure to check
   the Academic Calendar.  A W has no academic consequences.  It is just
   a historical record of you changing your mind.
-  Withdrawal later during classes:  W on the transcript and a partial
   or complete tuition penalty.  Do not get yourself into this situation
   just by not paying attention!
 
The categories are the same for CSIS courses, but the procedures can be
more complicated.  See the section on CSIS Courses above.

.. index:: changing MS programs

Changing your chosen MS Program
-----------------------------------------------------------

It is easy to switch between our MS degree programs in the department. 
Through the gsps system under student forms in
https://gsps.luc.edu/, find Change in Degree Seeking.  You will need to
include a statement about why you want to change the program.

.. index:: transfer of credit

Transfer of Credit into the Loyola MS Program from Earlier Graduate Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

During your first semester, you can apply to transfer up to 6 credits of
previous *graduate* work relevant to your current program.   Your official
transcripts need to show B or better in relevant courses.  (In
particular, we must have your official transcripts already!)
International students, see :ref:`international_transfer`.
In the unusual case where the transcript is only available after admission,
get your *official* transcript to the GPD.  
Although official transcripts are needed to forward the request to the
Grad School for final approval, you are welcomed to show unofficial
transcripts to the GPD to see if you have appropriate courses.

.. index:: international transfer credit

.. _international_transfer:

Further International Transcript Credit Transfer Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------
   
International transcripts need only a *general* evaluation by ECE,
http://www.ece.org/, or
Educational Perspectives, http://www.educational-perspectives.org/,
for *admission*, but they need a *course by course* evaluation to
*transfer* international graduate credit.  It is most economical to ask
for the course by course evaluation the first time transcripts are
submitted to an evaluator, if you are expecting to get transfer credit.

Note:  All courses, including graduate courses in your first 4 years 
since the start of college, are considered part of your undergraduate education.
Only if you do MS work *past* the four years of academic work can 
transfer credit be considered.

.. index:: grades

Grades
--------------------------------

The grading system used in the Graduate School is as follows:

.. csv-table:: Grading System
   	:header: "Grade", "Grade Points"
   	:widths: 15, 15

   	"A",4.00
	"A–",3.67

	"B",3.00
	"B–",2.67
	"C+",2.33

	"I","Incomplete"
	"W","Withdrawal"
	"WF","Withdrawal, Failure"
	"CR","Credit"
	"NC","No Credit"
	"AU","Audit"

For further information on Loyola’s grading policy, consult the Graduate School Catalog.

Graduate students in the Computer Science Department are expected to maintain an average 
of not less than B (3.0). Those who fail to meet this requirement may be 
dismissed by the Graduate School. 
No more than two grades below B and no grades of C- or less
may be counted as fulfilling degree requirements.
*Still C-, D or F  do count to enormously drag down your GPA*.

.. index:: incomplete grade I

Incomplete Grade
--------------------------------

Faculty may assign the grade of I to a student who has not completed the assigned 
work by the end of the term. This grade is not assigned automatically; 
rather, it is up to the student to work out with the instructor a plan, 
including a deadline, for completing the work for the course. 

Under the Graduate School regulations, a student has one semester to complete the course
(and summer counts as a semester!). 
If the student does not turn in the work by the deadline, 
the I grade will automatically become an F.  
Please read the new policy on the Graduate School web page at 
http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml#grades1.

Although it is not uncommon for graduate students to take an occasional Incomplete, 
it is of course better not to take an incomplete when possible. 
Making up an incomplete course often proves harder than students expect, 
particularly if much time has elapsed since the end of the course. 
In any case, faculty members have various policies regarding Incompletes, 
so it is advisable to discuss the matter with your instructor as early as possible 
if you anticipate the need for an Incomplete. 

.. index:: academic honesty
   cheating
   plagiarism

Academic Honesty
--------------------------------

Although academic dishonesty can take many forms, in our field it manifests 
primarily as plagiarism of text or source code. 
The Graduate School Catalog defines plagiarism as “the appropriation for gain of ideas, 
language or work of another without sufficient public acknowledgement that the material 
is not one’s own.” As a graduate student, you very likely have a good understanding 
of the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not. 
If you are ever uncertain, it is of course best to consult the 
Director of Graduate Programs or another faculty member.

The penalty for an instance of plagiarism is, at a minimum, failure on the assignment,
which may well be tantamount to failure in the course. 
A serious breach or a pattern of dishonesty can lead to expulsion from Loyola. 
Although quite rare in our department, cases have occurred in the past and have 
resulted in dismissal.

.. index:: grievance procedure

Grievance Procedure
----------------------------------

Students, faculty, and administrators are strongly encouraged to resolve any problems 
they encounter in the academic process through informal discussion. 
If you are unable to resolve a problem with a member of the staff or faculty, 
or if you wish to lodge a formal complaint, you should first meet to discuss the matter 
with the Director of Graduate Programs. If the problem cannot be satisfactorily 
resolved by the GPD, it will be taken up by the Department Chair. 
Violations of the University’s ethical standards not resolvable within the Department 
may call for the use of the Graduate School’s grievance procedure. 
Students wishing to initiate a grievance must do so in writing to the Dean. 
Further information can be obtained from the Graduate School office.
