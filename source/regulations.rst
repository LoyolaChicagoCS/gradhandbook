Regulations and Procedures
================================

This section covers specific policies of the Computer Science Department and
makes reference to some of the most important governing  policies and procedure
of the Graduate School, http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml,
but this Computer Science Handbook *does not attempt to duplicate the statement
of all Graduate School policies*.

.. index:: deadlines 
   dates for Grad School
   
**The Graduate School takes deadlines very seriously.**  All Graduate School
key academic and administrative deadlines and starting dates are listed at
http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/key_dates.shtml.

.. index:: course loads
   full-time

Course Loads
--------------------------------

A full-time student will usually carry three courses in fall and spring
semesters. Course loads for part-time students are worked out on an individual
basis. 

We do not encourage students to take more than 3 courses a term, and you should
contact the Graduate Program Director if you need to take more than 3 courses
in a term for any reason. It is explicitly prohibited to enroll in more than 3
courses to hold a space in a course. Many of our courses fill up quickly, so
you should only register for courses that you truly plan to complete.  No one
is allowed to take more than 12 credit hours in Fall or Spring.

This means most students finish the program in 16 months: Three fall/spring
semesters for 9 of the courses, and the intervening summer for one course.
Some students take an extra summer course, leaving a reduced load for the last
semester, when it may be particularly convenient to devote time to a job or job
search.

.. index:: registration

Registration
--------------------------------

Both new and continuing students must complete the process of registration
before every semester in which they are either attending classes or writing a
thesis (applicable only to MS Computer Science students opting to complete a
thesis). For details on choosing courses see :ref:`course_selection` and
:ref:`advising` below.

Students must maintain continual registration throughout their years in the
program unless they explicitly apply for and are approved for a
:ref:`leave_of_absence`.  You must also announce your decision to come back
from a Leave of Absence with an email to the Associate Dean of the Graduate
School.  Only after the Graduate School accepts your letter announcing your
plan to return, will you be allowed to register for classes.
    
After registration opens you can register yourself through LOCUS for most
courses with just your student ID number. 

*New students should get course advising first from the department*, and all
others are welcomed to get advising. 

.. index:: permission required
 
*You cannot register yourself for Comp 490 or 499* as both require permission
of the GPD or instructor of record. See sections :ref:`independent_study` and
:ref:`internships`. Other courses that can have complications registering and
dropping are the CSIS courses, depending on when you want to register for or
drop a course. See :ref:`CSIS_courses` below.

In any course where there is a note about *consent or permission required*, you
must make a direct emailed request to the department, *clearly stating* the
course and *section* (if more than one is offered) and *semester*, and number
of *credits* if that is variable. If you are asking for a course that requires
permisison of the instructor, please add your direct request to an approving
email that you forward from the instructor.  The department then gives consent
and *does your registration administratively*.  Within a few days you should
confirm in Locus that your request was correctly entered.

.. index:: registration blocks

It is in your best interest to register early, to get into sections you want
and have ample time to detect and clear up any possible registration block that
may have been placed.  Common examples are an immunization block, a conditional
admission block, or a bursar block.  Students have been given late fees or had
a lot of trouble due to delay from such blocks.  One misleading feature in
LOCUS is that all MS students have a Dean's time limit block, but it does not
activate until you have been an MS student for five years - do not worry about
that one.  *You are strongly encouraged to check in Locus weeks before
registration opens,* *to see if a block appears*, and get it addressed so it
will not delay your registration.

.. index:: course selection
   selecting courses

.. _course_selection:

Course Selection
------------------

Even before you get access to our registration system, you can still look for
courses you are interested in.  

Some time before registration opens there should be a link under
http://www.luc.edu/cs/schedules/ labeled with the name of the upcoming semester
with a detailed list of courses to be offered, with links to the individual
course descriptions and recent syllabi.

Before that, or looking further ahead, you can look at the long-term schedule,
showing what courses are planned for what semesters:
http://courses.cs.luc.edu/html/longtermschedule.html.  This is particularly
useful if you find too many courses that interest you for a given semester:
look at the long-term schedule to see which of those courses you could defer
until it is offered again.  

Detailed descriptions of most of these courses are in
http://courses.cs.luc.edu/html/

Comp 271 is the prerequisite for most graduate courses, but Comp 413,
Intermediate Object-Oriented Programming, is a prerequisite for the most
advanced software courses.  Many students, with even a strong undergraduate
computer science background, have not had the subject matter described in
http://courses.cs.luc.edu/html/comp413.html.  If you are in either the MS in SE
or CS program, and have not had much of this material, it is a good course to
*start* with (offered every fall and spring), since it is required of both
programs, and you want to be able to later get into the courses that have it as
a prerequisite.  IT students who want to mix in more software-centric electives
should also consider Comp 413.

Note, SE and CS students with prior experience with the Comp 413 material can
replace the Comp 413 course requirement: after consulting with your advisor,
substitute one of the courses which has Comp 413 as a prerequisite.

**Caution to Computer Science students**:  Comp 460 is required, and it is not
offered every semester:  You may not be able to defer it!  Make sure you have
arranged a place in your plans that fit with the semesters that it is offered. 

.. index:: advising

.. _advising:

Advising
-----------

Newly admitted students should first consult with the Graduate Program Director
before registering for courses. A discussion with the GPD is particularly
important if there is any question of a student's prerequisite preparation.

Before the next registration period, you should be provided an individual
faculty advisor for the rest of your studies.  Later registration choices
should be taken up with your advisor.

.. index:: online courses

.. _online-courses:

Online Courses
----------------

Nhile the majority of our courses are face to face in regularly scheduled class
sessions (likely with *some* online interaction), other courses can be done
*totally* online.  The learning objectives and outcomes of online courses are
the same as for face-to-face classes, but obviously with a somewhat different
delivery.

There are many models that an instructor can choose for online:  Parts can
include recorded video presentations, synchronous whole-class sessions,
synchronous small-group sessions, 1-1 with instructor online, threaded
discussions, wiki contributions, totally asynchronous involvement as long as
you are active each day, ....
 
There may be notes in the course list beside an online course.  If you want
more details about the format, contact the instructor.

The `long-term schedule
<http://courses.cs.luc.edu/html/longtermschedule.html>`_ includes an indication
of what courses to expect to be online.

At present there is no guarantee of being able to complete a degree totally
online, though we are moving in that direction with increased offerings.

.. index:: F-1 online limiting rules

**F-1 students**:  Note that in the semesters that you are supposed to be
full-time, you may have only one online course, and at least one course must
not be online.  If you are not required to be in school in a semester 
(commonly summer), there are no restrictions.  Please confer with the Office
of International Programs for details and confirmation.


.. index:: independent study Comp 490
   Comp 490 independent study

.. _independent_study:

Independent Study
--------------------------------

If you are doing an independent project for Comp 490, you need to find a
faculty member to supervise your project and have the faculty supervisor email
the department secretary to register you. This does not generally make sense in
your first semester but is possible in exceptional circumstances.  It helps if
you and the faculty member are familiar with each other.  Talk to your
instructors outside of class, and take advantage of community seminars and
events to meet and get to know faculty!  It is particularly helpful when you
want to do something that the professor already wants done.  At the other end
of the spectrum, a student might just propose something that sounds interesting
to a potential faculty supervisor who knows the student is self-motivated.  Or
a project could end up somewhere in between: something the professor is
interested in, with a particular twist that appeals to the student....

The typical approach is for the student to meet with the faculty member and
then confirm the details of the agreement in an email to the faculty
supervisor, being sure to include the exact *semester and credit hours* that
your have agreed on. The supervisor then forwards the email with his or her
approval to the *graduate secretary*, so she can register you. Your agreement
does *not* go to the GPD.  The GPD approves internships, but not independent
study.

These courses are for 1-6 credits. See the section below on variable hour
courses. We rarely allow students to take more than 6 total credits in their
overall program for the sum of Independent Study and Internships, but do allow
further high-level independent study in exceptional circumstances.

In most cases, we recommend that you and your independent study advisor fill
out a *request for course title form*, which is available at
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Request%20for%20Course%20Title.pdf
The Graduate Program Director must sign this form.  This is very useful when
someone else is reading your transcript: Plain "Independent Study" on your
transcript is totally uninformative!



.. index:: internships Comp 499
   Comp 499 Internship

.. _internships:

Internships (COMP 499)
-----------------------------------------------

First, you need to find a job for the period of the Internship.  There are
online, searchable listings through the university career center,
`http://www.luc.edu/career <http://www.luc.edu/career>`_. (The Computer Science
department also maintains an *informal* jobs list at http://jobs.cs.luc.edu.)
When you find a job, contact the GPD and get your job description approved.  
Internships are for 1-6 credits.  See
:ref:`variable_credit_courses`.  
   
Download, *read*, print, fill out *both pages*, and return the `MOU Form
<https://luc.box.com/CS-Grad-Internship-MOU>`_.  Please read this carefully
before asking questions of the GPD.  It contains a description of the details
of your academic requirements for the course.  You will also need your job
supervisor's signature.  Get the finished form to the GPD, so we can register
you for the course for the proper 
number of credits.  

The form can be scanned and emailed or turn in paper to the department staff.
If you are doing :ref:`cpt`, turn in the CPT form at the same time.

There are three related but different terms: **job**, **internship**, and
**CPT**, :ref:`cpt`. You can have a job and not have it be an internship for
academic credit, or you can have a job that goes on longer than an academic
internship. Also if you are doing an academic internship, your job employer
does not need to classify your position as "internship". If you are doing an
academic internship, the `MOU <https://luc.box.com/CS-Grad-Internship-MOU>`_
indicates only two small requirements for your employer during your time in the
academic internship: The bulk of your duties must be related to doing computer
science in the real world, and the supervisor will write a few line email at
the end of the time of the academic internship indicating your successful
completion of all the hours required for the academic internship.

**Service Internships**:  Though most students choose a well-paid internship,
some choose an *unpaid* internship for a worthy, nonprofit cause.  In this case
the tuition for the internship can be a burden.  Contact the GPD about whether
your service may be such that the Dean would agree to waive tuition.  If
possible, this should be clarified well in advance.

.. index:: curricular practical training (CPT)

.. _cpt:

Curricular Practical Training (For F-1 students)
-----------------------------------------------------------

You should consult with the `Office for International Programs(OIP)
<http://www.luc.edu/oip>`_ for the full legal details of CPT.

Here are a few of the important points.  If you get a job on campus, like the
considerable number of students who have worked for Loyola's Information
Services, you do not need to be doing CPT and no CPT restrictions apply.  If
you want to work off campus for pay, then you need to be doing CPT, and there
are a number of requirements.

First of all, you need to have been a full-time F-1 student anywhere in the
United States for two semesters.  Optionally, this could include
:ref:`summer_full_time`.

To start CPT you must get an application submitted in one of two routes. In
both cases with the CPT application you should provide a written job offer
(which can be an email) from the prospective employer. The completed CPT
application must be delivered to the International Office, and they will issue
the work permit. The form to start CPT can be found `here
<http://www.luc.edu/iss/forms.shtml>`_.

The CPT can be tied to an academic course in either of two ways. You get a
signature on the CPT application differently in the two cases.  *Be sure
completely fill out the form except for the faculty signature and date* *before
looking for a signature!* Do not leave us to guess which of the two options you
want:

* You can take the Comp 499 course specifically for :ref:`internships`,
  with the regular tuition charge per credit.  Get the form with
  your MOU and job offer to the GPD, and the 
  GPD will get the application 
  completed and forwarded to the OIP with the job offer.
* For no extra
  tuition you are likely to be able to tie it to a course you are
  already planning to take. There is a section of the CPT application for this.
  You can get the *signature on the CPT form of an instructor* to pair the
  internship with a course in the same semester, *or for a fall course*
  and an internship in the *previous summer*.  
  Show the instructor the offer letter. 
  If you do the no-extra-tuition option,
  you are able to work but you *get no further credit toward graduation*,
  and the course instructor is responsible for determining any extra
  reporting or work you do to tie the internship to the instructor's
  course.  *You may need to send the CPT form and job offer to the OIP yourself.*


.. index:: F-1 full-time in summer
   summer full time status
   
.. _summer_full_time:

F-1 Summer Full-time Status
----------------------------

F-1 students who do not start in summer, do not need to study at all in the
summer as long as they are full-time in each fall and spring until they finish.
For them, summer courses are optional.  (In the semester that you finish up,
you are automatically full-time, even if you have only 1-2 courses left, though
the GPD does need to confirm with the OIP when your 1-2 courses allow you to
finish.)

F-1 students starting in summer do need to be classified as full-time.  Also
students who start in spring may find it convenient to be full-time in summer
to allow :ref:`cpt` to start a semester earlier than otherwise.

To have summer count automatically as full time for an F-1 student, you need to
be taking 9 credits in total among all the different summer sessions.  This is
hard to do for two reasons: It is a lot of work to cram 3 courses into 12
weeks, and we offer a limited number of courses in summer, so it may be hard to
fit your interests with 3 courses.  These restrictions allow for a possible
opening: With permission from the GPD and OIP, one time in your F-1 career you
are allowed to take fewer courses and still be counted as full-time.  You can
ask the GPD to approve this reduction in summer because of the issues listed
above.  You are *cautioned* that if you do this, *you cannot make such a
reduction for a later semester*, even if you have a good reason, like illness.

Be sure to check with the OIP for the exact current details and correct forms
to ask the GPD to sign.

.. index:: variable credit courses
.. _variable_credit_courses:

Variable Credit Courses
-----------------------------------------------------------

Comp 490 and 499 are for 1-6 credits. Up to 6 credits total can be counted
toward graduation, counting all the times you register for these two courses.
(In practice that usually means 3 or 6 credits since all other courses are 3
credits.) You do not need to take a multiple of three credits at a time. What
matters is the total, when it is time to graduate. 

.. index:: CSIS courses
   Business School
   GSB
   quarter courses

   Changing CSIS courses

.. _CSIS_courses:

CSIS Courses
-----------------------------------------------------------

CSIS courses are special sections set up to give you credit in the Computer
Science MS program for courses offered by the Graduate School of Business.
They broaden the Computer Science offerings and let you essentially take GSB
courses at the Graduate School's much lower tuition rate.  There are a number
of special considerations coming from the fact that GSB courses are *quarter*
courses.  They have the same holidays as in The Graduate School semester
system, but exam times or term start times or both are different.  The main
administrative issue is that this confuses LOCUS, the school online
administration system.  Fall Quarter starts with Fall semester, but ends in
November.  Winter Quarter goes from November into February, spanning parts of
both Fall and Spring Semesters.  A fairly arbitrary decision was made to list
Winter Quarter CSIS courses under Fall semester in LOCUS.  Spring Quarter
Courses do not start until February. 

Because Winter Quarter spans two semesters, it is very important to look at the
Spring Semester schedule for COMP courses before registering for a Winter
Quarter course.  Registration for a Winter Quarter course will make it
impossible for you to register for a Spring Semester COMP course on the same
night.  Even if you check an early Spring Semester schedule before signing up
for a Winter Quarter course, you run the risk of a later change to the Spring
semester schedule creating a conflict.  We make ever effort to keep the spring
semester schedule stable, but unexpected things can always come up.

LOCUS lists CSIS courses as semester courses, so if you look at your current
course list in October, you will see both Fall and Winter Quarter courses
included!  *You* have to know the *real* calendar.

Particular issues arise with registering for and dropping CSIS courses outside
the times LOCUS is expecting.  If you register and add or drop in the regular
semester time limits (much earlier than the time Winter and Spring quarter
courses actually start), then you should be able to do your registration
changes by yourself, online, in LOCUS, with no problem.  Please do that where
possible.  On the other hand, **if you want to make changes closer to the time
Winter and Spring Quarter** **courses actually start**, you should make all
registraion requests through the GPD, gpd@cs.luc.edu.  Since the department
ends up making registration changes which are very important to you, we need
explicit directions and you need to indicate clear knowledge of the
ramifications of your choices.  Include the following in your email:

**Registration request** to gpd@cs.luc.edu after the normal LOCUS semester
registration time limit and before the GSB registeration time limit for Winter
or Spring: 

#. Include a direct request like "Please register me for CSIS XXX
   Section YYY for ZZZ Quarter." *not* an indirect question like "Would
   it be OK if I register for....?"
#. Include your full name and Student ID number.
#. Explicitly acknowledge the drop deadlines and the timeframe and
   manner you must notify us to get you dropped (as further discussed
   below).   You could include something like "I know I must email you
   with an explicit request to drop the course by XX/XX/XXXX if I want
   no trace left for the course and by YY/YY/YYYY to avoid tuition, but
   still get a W on my transcript."  The dates are publicized at the
   `Bursar's web site <http://www.luc.edu/bursar/withdraw_schedule.shtml#gsb>`_. 
   We will try to include them also on our course web pages for Winter
   and Spring Quarters.
#. It is also possible to request a swap for an already running course 
   that will overlap the later starting course, if you got access to a
   CSIS course opening after the normal drop deadline.  
   Of course in this case your email needs to 
   also clearly state the course you wish to swap out of.

**Drop requests** after the normal LOCUS semester drop/add time limit,
but inside the limits set by the Graduate School of Business:

#. Within the limits set by the GSB, make the drop in Locus.  This will
   drop you and note the time of your decision.
#. Email gpd@cs.luc.edu and explain when you dropped what exact course,
   and ask us to backdate the withdrawal to make up for LOCUS's
   incorrect understanding of dates.
#. Include your full name and Student ID number.

The time of dropping the course is crucial in determining its effect.  Be aware
of the GSB deadlines for getting the course dropped with no trace and the later
deadline for avoiding  tuition.  We will be correct things if you are before
the GSB deadlines.  See below under Dropping a Course for further discussion of
the categories. 

F-1 visa students  
    If you are keeping 3 real Fall semester courses, 
    and you add a winter quarter course, 
    it can be counted for visa purposes as one of the 3 courses that you need 
    for full-time status in spring.  
    Check with the Office of International Programs for details.

.. index:: graduation
   deadline; for applying for graduation

Graduation
-----------------------------------------------------------

Degrees are conferred in May, August, and December.  You must apply for
graduation **way in advance** of graduation or the official conferral of your
degree will be **postponed**. The GPD will not be able to appeal this for you.
Note that there are only graduation *ceremonies* in May.

**Deadlines**: December 1 for Spring, February 1 for Summer graduation, August
1 for Fall graduation.  See the discussion of ceremonies below if you want to
participate in a graduation ceremony and you graduate in Summer or Fall.

**Procedure**: Go into Locus and submit your application for graduation *by the
deadline*.  That is all you need to do if you are on time.  There is no penalty
for guessing early about when you will graduate, but you will need to apply
again for the actual time.

You can apply  up to 15 days later, *with a penalty fee* and *walking a piece
of paper around*:  see
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/LATE%20Application%20to%20Receive%20a%20Degree.pdf
In case the URL changes, it should be listed on the Graduate School Forms page
under Late Application for Graduation.

If your last course is a CSIS course in Winter Quarter, register for Spring
graduation, even though Winter Quarter courses are listed under Fall semester
in LOCUS.  Of course you will not really graduate until after Winter Quarter
courses end in February.

**Graduation Ceremonies are only in May**:  If you have only *one* course left
for summer, you can ask to participate in the *previous* May graduation.  This
one course can be 490/499 for more than 3 credits.  To do this you must apply
for summer graduation by the deadline listed above and promptly email the GPD,
asking for approval to walk in the May ceremony.  If you graduate in the Summer
or Fall, you can choose to return to participate in the *following* May
graduation ceremony (unless you already participated in the previous May
graduation, as discussed above).

.. index:: leave of absence
   reinstatement form

.. _leave_of_absence:

Leave of Absence
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once you start graduate school, the default assumption is that you will be
enrolled each fall and spring until you sign up for graduation and graduate. If
you need to interrupt your studies before that, the Graduate School requires
that you apply for a leave of absence through the gsps system, under student
forms in https://gsps.luc.edu/. 

After being approved for a leave, you will need to notify the Associate Dean of
the Graduate School of your intent to enroll before you can register for
classes and resume study. See the address under :ref:`graduate-school-offices`.

If you *neglect to request a Leave*, the return process is longer and less
sure:  You need to fill out the **Reinstatement** form,
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Reinstatement%20Request.pdf,
and return it to the GPD (preferably as an emailed electronic scan).

.. note::
   Besides the reinstatement form itself being filled out you need to 
   return a document with two other parts:
   
   * The reason for your absence.  (The form says reason for reinstatement -
     but it means reason for *absence*.)
   * Timeline to graduation:  When you plan to be back and when you plan
     to finish.

Dropping a Course, Avoiding Extra Bills
-----------------------------------------------------------

You should always be able to withdraw yourself from the course in LOCUS, no
matter how you got registered for a course: by yourself in LOCUS, by a request
to the department staff, or off of a waiting list. If you are sure you want to
withdraw from a course, do not waste time emailing the department for help,
just do it yourself. The date that the withdrawal is entered into LOCUS affects
whether you get a W on your transcript, and whether tuition is still due.
Different dates apply.  Be sure to look at the Academic Calendar for the given
semester. Once you are registered, merely not attending class does **NOT**
extend these dates.

-  Withdrawal with no trace: Generally by the end of the first week of
   ful Fall and Spring semesters. Generally only through the first Tuesday
   of the semester for Summer session. 
-  Withdrawal with only a W on the transcript, and no tuition due:
   Generally during the second week of Fall and Spring semesters.
   Sometime during the first week in summer sessions. Be sure to check
   the Academic Calendar at http://www.luc.edu/academics/schedules/.  
   A W has no academic consequences.  It is just
   a historical record of you changing your mind.
-  Withdrawal later during classes: W on the transcript and a partial
   or complete tuition penalty. Do not get yourself into this situation
   just by not paying attention!
 
The categories are the same for CSIS courses, but the procedures can be
more complicated.  See the section on CSIS Courses above.

.. index:: changing MS programs

Changing your chosen MS Program
-----------------------------------------------------------

It is easy to switch between our MS degree programs in the department.  Through
the gsps system under student forms in https://gsps.luc.edu/, find Change in
Degree Seeking.  You will need to include a statement about why you want to
change the program.  Do think carefully.  The Dean is less likely to approve a
request to return to your original program! 

.. index:: transfer credit

.. _transfer_credit:

Transfer Credit
------------------

By the end of your *first* semester, you can apply to transfer up to 6 credits
of previous *graduate* work relevant to your current program.  Do not delay!
Your official transcripts need to show B or better in relevant courses.  For
conditionally admitted students, Loyola must already have the relevant official
transcript. International students, see :ref:`international_transfer`.  In the
unusual case where the transcript is only available after admission, get your
*official* transcript to the GPD.  Although official transcripts are needed to
forward the request to the Grad School for final approval, you are welcomed to
show unofficial transcripts to the GPD to see if you have appropriate courses.  

Note:  All courses, including graduate courses in your first 4 years since the
start of college, are considered part of your undergraduate education.  Only if
you do MS work *past* the four years of academic work can transfer credit be
considered.

International transcripts need only a *general* evaluation with GPA by ECE,

http://www.educational-perspectives.org/, for *admission*, but they need a
*course by course* evaluation to *transfer* international graduate credit.  If
you are expecting to get transfer credit, it is most economical to ask for the

Graduate students in the Computer Science Department are expected to maintain
an average of not less than B (3.0) during their course of study.  Those who
fail to meet this requirement may be dismissed by the Graduate School.  No more
than two grades of C or C+ and no grades of C- or less may be counted as
fulfilling degree requirements.  *Still C-, D or F  do count to enormously drag
down your cumulative GPA!*

.. index:: incomplete grade I

Incomplete Grade
--------------------------------

Faculty may assign the grade of I to a student who has not completed the
assigned work by the end of the term for some good reason.  This grade is *not*
assigned automatically.  It is up to the student to explain the circumstances
and work out a plan with the instructor, including a deadline, for completing
the work for the course. 

Under the Graduate School regulations, a student has one semester to complete
the course (and summer counts as a semester!).  If the student does not turn in
the work by the deadline, the I grade will automatically become an F.  Please
read the new policy on the Graduate School web page at
http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml#grades1.

Although it is not uncommon for graduate students to take an occasional
Incomplete, it is of course better not to take an incomplete when possible.
Making up an incomplete course often proves harder than students expect,
particularly if much time has elapsed since the end of the course.  In any
case, faculty members have various policies regarding Incompletes, so it is
advisable to discuss the matter with your instructor as early as possible if
you anticipate the need for an Incomplete.

Academic Honesty
--------------------------------

Although academic dishonesty can take many forms, in our field it manifests
primarily as plagiarism of text or source code.  The Graduate School Catalog
defines plagiarism as "the appropriation for gain of ideas, language or work of
another without sufficient public acknowledgement that the material is not
one's own."  As a graduate student, you very likely have a good understanding
of the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not.  If you are ever
uncertain, it is of course best to consult the GPD or another faculty member.

The penalty for an instance of plagiarism is, at a minimum, failure on the
assignment, which may well be tantamount to failure in the course.  A serious
breach or a pattern of dishonesty can lead to expulsion from Loyola.  Although
quite rare in our department, cases have occurred in the past and have resulted
in dismissal.

.. index:: grievance procedure

Grievance Procedure
----------------------------------

Students, faculty, and administrators are strongly encouraged to resolve any
problems they encounter in the academic process through informal discussion.
If you are unable to resolve a problem with a member of the staff or faculty,
or if you wish to lodge a formal complaint, you should first meet to discuss
the matter with the GPD. If the problem cannot be satisfactorily resolved by
the GPD, it will be taken up by the Department Chair.  Violations of the
University's ethical standards not resolvable within the Department may call
for the use of the Graduate School's grievance procedure.  Students wishing to
initiate a grievance must do so in writing to the Dean.  Further information
can be obtained from the Graduate School office.
