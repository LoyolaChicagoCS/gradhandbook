<p>Each year the Computer Science department offers a small number of graduate assistantships
for new and continuing students. Assistantships are competitive and
target students with exceptional interpersonal and
computing background, regardless of which degree you are pursuing.
For a full teaching-assistantship for a full academic year,
there are duties for 18 hours per week in fall and spring semesters
in computer labs, in support of faculty teaching or research projects,
or in network or web support in the department.
The most recent awards included $18,000 in stipend.
Full-time tuition in fall and spring plus medical insurance are also included in a full award.</p>
<p>New merit awards are not given for summer semesters.</p>
<p>Research Assistantships in computer science may also be available from
time to time depending upon the availability of faculty research grants.
Other units of the university sometimes offer TA awards for computer
science students. There is no separate application for seeking a research
assistantship or TA awards in other units of the university.
All applications are initially reviewed by the Graduate Program Director.</p>

<span id="new-student-merit"></span><span id="index-1"></span><h2>New Student Assistantships<a class="headerlink" href="#new-student-assistantships" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>New applicants to the Master’s programs in computer science should
get an email from the GPD when admission is first recommended.
This email should have a link near the end to a form to apply for a TA award.
Be sure to note the application <em>deadlines</em> in the list below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Have your application complete
by the <strong>deadline</strong> date of <em>February 15 for Fall admission</em> or
<em>September 15 for Spring admission</em>.  Promptly fill out the
form at the link provided by the GPD when acknowledging your
admission recommendation.  Make sure in your application
that you had an <em>email address that you check regularly</em>, or update
your current email address with the GPD (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:gpd&#37;&#52;&#48;cs&#46;luc&#46;edu">gpd<span>&#64;</span>cs<span>&#46;</span>luc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>).</li>
<li>Have excellent undergraduate performance, including all MS prerequisites.</li>
<li>International students should have a strong TOEFL, IELTS or Loyola ESL score.
Students with under a 105 TOEFL or 7.5 IELTS will generally not be considered
at all, and higher scores are preferable.</li>
<li>Submit excellent letters of recommendation for graduate admission.</li>
<li>Submit official GRE scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>For new students who receive an assistantship, it is customary for the department
to make a commitment to the end of the academic
year, with an understanding to continue for up to a total of three semesters
if funds are available for the next academic year, and if the students
maintain their academic and work standards.</p>
<p>The aim is to announce the awards before March 1 for Fall,
and in October for Spring.</p>
<p>If you miss these deadlines you may apply in your first semester or later
as a <em>current</em> student.</p>

<div class="section" id="current-student-requirements-and-deadlines">
<h2>Current Student Requirements and Deadlines<a class="headerlink" href="#current-student-requirements-and-deadlines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Continuing students’
<em>recent academic experience at Loyola</em> is
the most important consideration in giving a new award.</p>
<p>Continuing students will get an
<em>emailed reminder to their Loyola address several weeks before the deadline</em>.  The
reminder will include the URL for an online form to fill out as your application.
Note that the deadlines are <em>earlier</em> than for just admitted students:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Continuing students fill out the online form by <em>March 15 for Fall awards</em>,
and by <em>October 15 for Spring awards</em>.</div></blockquote>
<p>Students who have already been given an award for the upcoming semester should
not fill out the form. Initial awards for current students are generally
finalized after the awards to new students are completed.</p>

<div class="section" id="possible-english-exam-given-by-loyola">
<h2>Possible English Exam Given By Loyola<a class="headerlink" href="#possible-english-exam-given-by-loyola" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Awardees who did not grow up in the US may be required by the Graduate
School to take an extra English test on campus,
<em>even if they have other English language certifications</em>.
The standards for TA’s are <em>higher</em> than the
entrance requirements.  Someone who did not score high enough on the Loyola
test will be required to take ESL in the first semester after the exam,
and <em>pay the extra tuition</em> - TA tuition awards may not be used.  The
cost has generally been about the same as one regular graduate academic credit.
The need to actually take the ESL course has rarely happened with students we
made a TA,
but it is important to note it as a possibility.</p>
