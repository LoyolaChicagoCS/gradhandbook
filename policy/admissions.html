<p>Applications are continuously evaluated and students will be promptly admitted to the nearest starting term or semester. Earlier admission means that you get to register online for classes earlier, and some classes may fill up. In particular, registration for Fall starts in April, for Spring in late October, and for Summer in February. It is to your advantage to be admitted before those times for the earliest access to advising and registration.</p>

<p>For admission to the graduate degree program in the Department of Computer Science, submit the items below that <strong>are not listed as optional</strong>. You may also submit further items if you feel they would help bolster your admissions case.</p>

<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>For navigating the application, note that the programs are in the <strong>School of Arts and Sciences</strong>, and all are offered by the Computer Science department, so the Information Technology and Software Engineering degree names are prefixed by “Computer Science”</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>The application requires you to fill in <em>all</em> the personal data before showing you all the programs that you can apply to and other parts of the form.</p>

<p>Do not open such envelopes yourself!</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you do not have easy access to the sealed official documents, you can <em>initially</em> submit copies for a <em>conditional</em> admission.</p>
</div>
<p>You can send a transcript in the semester before your graduation, showing all the courses you will be having for graduation, even though grades are still missing from the final courses, and still be eligible for conditional admission.</p>
<p><strong>Do not send transcripts too early to show a listing of all the courses you will end up taking for your degree</strong>.</p>
<p>In all cases, final officially-sent transcripts are required by the end of your first semester at Loyola.</p>

<h3>Additional Requirements for International Applicant<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-requirements-for-international-applicant" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Do not forget the general prerequisites!</p>
</div>
<p>Here are <em>additional</em> requirements and an option for international student admission to the graduate degree programs in the Department of Computer Science.</p>
<p>Though there is no admission deadline, be sure to leave time to get the necessary official English test results and transcript evaluations to Loyola before admission, and allow time after admission for obtaining a visa.</p>
<p>If the process takes too long, you can request to roll your admission over to the next semester.</p>
<section id="submitting-and-verifying-transcripts">
<h4>Submitting and Verifying transcripts<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-and-verifying-transcripts" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Students with transcripts issued by international universities or colleges must be <em>evaluated</em> by an outside evaluator for GPA calculation and determining if the degree is equivalent to an American Bachelor’s degree (four-year degree or 3-year degree with an extra year of study after that),</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Applicants may send international transcripts for a general evaluation with <strong>Grade Average</strong> to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ece.org/">ECE</a> for international evaluation and <em>allow 4-6 weeks</em> for them to evaluate transcripts and get the results to Loyola. <a class="reference external" href="http://edperspective.org/">Educational-Perspectives</a> can also be used as an alternative to ECE.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p><em>No other transcript evaluation service is accepted by Loyola</em>. If you are in a rush, you can pay extra for expedited service.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you do <em>not yet have your undergraduate degree</em>, you must send transcripts to the evaluator when all your final courses are shown, though some without grades. This is usually <em>in your final semester</em>.</p>
<p>The evaluators can only determine the equivalence to a US 4-year degree if they see all the relevant courses listed on the transcript (again, possibly some without grades yet).</p>
<p>The conditional admission requires the university to receive another official transcript, showing degree completion, though this transcript can be sent to Loyola during your first semester here as a student*.</p>
</div>
<p>If you have international graduate-level coursework after 4 years of college-level work, you  need a <em>course by course</em> evaluation to <em>transfer</em> international graduate credit.</p>
<p>If you are expecting to get transfer credit, it is most economical to ask for the course by course evaluation the <em>first</em> time transcripts are submitted to an evaluator.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Be sure the <em>rest</em> of your application is submitted when making this request, so it can be properly considered. Official notification of a passing English test score must be included at that time. Requesting that Loyola handle the evaluation will require <em>extra time</em>, since the transcript forms must be received first by Loyola and sent off again to Educational Perspectives.</p>
</div>

<section id="required-english-exam">
<h4>Required English Exam<a class="headerlink" href="#required-english-exam" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>The English requirement is waived for students meeting certain criteria, for example, US citizens, permanent residents, and citizens of certain countries. For a complete list, please see the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/gradschool/admission_international.html">LUC International Admission</a> page.</p>
<p>All other students will have to take an English exam such as TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, and Duolingo. Please see the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/gradschool/admission_international.html">LUC International Admission</a> page for more information on minimum scores.</p>
<p>If you do not meet the minimum scores, you can still be admitted conditionally to the ICAP program which requires you to complete the English Language Learning Program (ELLP) to determine your placement in ESL (English as a Second Language) preparation courses. For more information, please see the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/gradschool/admission_international.html">LUC International Admission</a> page</p>

<section id="visas">
<h4>Visas<a class="headerlink" href="#visas" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>International applicants who will be on an F-1 visa (including those who are seeking financial aid from the department) are encouraged to submit proof (affidavit) of financial support to our International students’ office <em>simultaneously</em> with filing their application.</p>
<p>The form should be linked on the page <a class="reference external" href="http://luc.edu/iss/forms.shtml">http://luc.edu/iss/forms.shtml</a> under something like the name, Declaration of Finances for Graduate &amp; Professional Students. This will help save a lot of time in processing the visa papers, namely I-20 or IAP-63. Students who are chosen for the merit awards or scholarships will be notified regardless of their financial standing or ability to support themselves financially.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Students who have written and defended a doctoral dissertation in English: make sure you note this in your application.</p>
