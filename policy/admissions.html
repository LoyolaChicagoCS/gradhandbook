<p>Applications are continuously evaluated and students will be promptly admitted to the nearest starting term or semester. Earlier admission means that you get to register online for classes earlier, and some classes may fill up. In particular, registration for Fall starts in April, for Spring in late October, and Summer in February. It is to your advantage to be admitted before those times for the earliest access to advising and registration.</p>

<p>Do not forget the general prerequisites!</p>
</div>
<p>Here are <em>additional</em> requirements and an option for international student admission to the graduate degree programs in the Department of Computer Science.</p>
<p>Though there is no admission deadline, be sure to leave time to get the necessary official English test results and transcript evaluations to Loyola before admission, and allow time after admission for obtaining a visa.</p>
<p>If the process takes too long, you can request to roll your admission over to the next semester.</p>
<section id="submitting-and-verifying-transcripts">
<h3>Submitting and Verifying transcripts<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-and-verifying-transcripts" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Students with transcripts issued by international universities or colleges must be <em>evaluated</em> by an outside evaluator for GPA calculation and determining if the degree is equivalent to an American Bachelor’s degree (four-year degree or 3-year degree with an extra year of study after that),</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Applicants may send international transcripts for a general evaluation with <strong>Grade Average</strong> to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ece.org/">ECE</a> for international evaluation and <em>allow 4-6 weeks</em> for them to evaluate transcripts and get the results to Loyola. <a class="reference external" href="http://edperspective.org/">Educational-Perspectives</a> can also be used as an alternative to ECE.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p><em>No other transcript evaluation service is accepted by Loyola</em>. If you are in a rush, you can pay extra for expedited service.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you do <em>not yet have your undergraduate degree</em>, you must send transcripts to the evaluator when all your final courses are shown, though some without grades. This is usually <em>in your final semester</em>.</p>
<p>The evaluators can only determine the equivalence to a US 4-year degree if they see all the relevant courses listed on the transcript (again, possibly some without grades yet).</p>
<p>The conditional admission requires the university to receive another official transcript, showing degree completion, though this transcript can be sent to Loyola during your first semester here as a student*.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>A suggested exception to getting the general transcript evaluation.</p>
</div>
<p>If you have international graduate-level coursework after 4 years of college-level work, you  need a <em>course by course</em> evaluation to <em>transfer</em> international graduate credit.</p>
<p>If you are expecting to get transfer credit, it is most economical to ask for the course by course evaluation the <em>first</em> time transcripts are submitted to an evaluator.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Be sure the <em>rest</em> of your application is submitted when making this request, so it can be properly considered. Official notification of a passing English test score must be included at that time. Requesting that Loyola handle the evaluation will require <em>extra time</em>, since the transcript forms must be received first by Loyola and sent off again to Educational Perspectives.</p>

<h4>Waiving the English Exam<a class="headerlink" href="#waiving-the-english-exam" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>The English requirement is <em>waived</em> only for students who satisfy at least one of the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>U.S. citizens and permanent residents.</p></li>
<li><p>Students with Bachelors or higher degree from accredited institutions in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, who primarily attended their classes in those countries. Students are exempt who will complete one of these programs before matriculation at Loyola, even if they have further degrees from another country.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Graduating from a program offered in English from any <em>other</em> country does <em>not</em> exempt the student from the English requirement.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you do not yet have the necessary test results for one of the above avenues, and your application is complete except for the English requirement, then the <a class="reference external" href="mailto:gpd&#37;&#52;&#48;cs&#46;luc&#46;edu">Graduate Program Director</a> is happy to look at your application and <em>informally</em> let you know if you should expect the <a class="reference external" href="mailto:gpd&#37;&#52;&#48;cs&#46;luc&#46;edu">Graduate Program Director’s</a> recommendation for admission, <em>after</em> obtaining a sufficient official English score for one of the routes above.

</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Having your university courses officially offered in English does <em>not</em> exempt you, though it should make passing the English exam easier.</p>

<section id="taking-the-english-exam">
<h4>Taking the English Exam<a class="headerlink" href="#taking-the-english-exam" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>International students (except for U.S. citizens or permanent residents) must have their English tested <em>before</em> any kind of admission. Different routes are depending on the results.</p>
<p>The Loyola Graduate School accepts just three approaches to the English requirement and a few explicit exceptions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The usual way is to earn at least 79 on the Internet-based TOEFL test (or 550 on the old paper-based test), at least a 6.5 (overall band score) on the IELTS academic test, or at least a 53 on the Pearson English Language Test (PTE Academic).</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>The new 3-score Internet-based TOEFL test requires at least Reading: 21, Listening: 21, and Writing: 23. The official results must come to Loyola directly from the testing agency. Loyola’s institutional code is 1412; a department code is not needed. In response to new difficulties where students are not able to take the TOEFL or IELTS test, we also accept the Duolingo online English proficiency tests with a score of at least 103.</p>
</div>
<p>With <em>lower scores</em>, see the other options below.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>You can <em>retake</em> an English exam as many times as you need <em>before</em> admission to get up to a passing grade.If taking one of these tests, be sure to sign up for an early test date, since results usually take 2-3 weeks to be delivered <em>officially</em> to Loyola.</p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>If you have a TOEFL in the range 70-78 or IELTS of 3.6.0, then you may be admitted conditionally to the new ICAP program where:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You will be required to take an English Placement Test administered by our English Language Learning Program (ELLP) to determine your placement in ESL preparation courses.The results of that exam will determine the required ESL courses you must take during your first term at Loyola. You will take ESL classes until your English language skills are strong enough for success in degree program courses.</p></li>
<li><p>If you receive a final grade of at least a B+ in all of your advanced or bridge ESL courses, you will be invited to take an exit exam at the end of the term. A combination of your course-work and exit exam score will be used to determine your readiness for degree work in the following term.</p></li>
<li><p>We offer ICAP admission to students who have demonstrated their academic abilities in the classroom but may need additional English language preparation and support to succeed in the degree program at Loyola University Chicago. Students in this program <strong>are classified</strong> as full-time graduate students.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is important to note that if testing indicates further language study is needed, you will be required to continue in the ELLP for another term.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For more information about Loyola’s ELLP, please contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ELLP&#37;&#52;&#48;luc&#46;edu">ELLP<span>&#64;</span>luc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a> , or <a class="reference external" href="tel+:17735083880">(773) 508-3880</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>You can choose to bring up your English score to the level of regular admission some other way and apply again later for regular admission.</p>
<p>However, the ICAP program gives you conditional admission and allows you to be on campus for various Computer Science activities, like seminars, hackathons, etc.</p>
</div>
<p>If you have not had an English test or the result is too low for ICAP, and you want to improve your English at Loyola, in preparation for possible graduate study, you can <em>first</em> apply to our full-time ESL program, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/esl/">http://www.luc.edu/esl/</a>, and do well enough in courses and a comprehensive exam.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Only sufficient achievement in <em>Loyola’s</em> ESL program is a substitute for one of the standardized tests above. Enrollment in an ESL program at another school is not a substitute for the TOEFL or IELTS. With any other ESL program, one of the standardized tests is still required.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Loyola’s ESL is a separate program from the Graduate School. If you were admitted directly to our ESL program, not to the Graduate School’s ICAP program, then an appropriate certification from this ESL program merely satisfies the English requirement for Graduate School applicants. It does not imply the Graduate School Dean’s approval for your admission.</p>

<section id="visas">
<h3>Visas<a class="headerlink" href="#visas" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>International applicants who will be on an F-1 visa (including those who are seeking financial aid from the department) are encouraged to submit proof (affidavit) of financial support to our International students’ office <em>simultaneously</em> with filing their application.</p>
<p>The form should be linked on the page <a class="reference external" href="http://luc.edu/iss/forms.shtml">http://luc.edu/iss/forms.shtml</a> under something like the name, Declaration of Finances for Graduate &amp; Professional Students. This will help save a lot of time in processing the visa papers, namely I-20 or IAP-63. Students who are chosen for the merit awards or scholarships will be notified regardless of their financial standing or ability to support themselves financially.</p>
