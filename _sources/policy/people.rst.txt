Graduate Program Director
=========================

Regardless of the MS program in which you're enrolled, your first adviser will be your |gpd|.

The current director for Software Engineering and Computer Science is `Dr. Eric Chan-Tin <https://chantin.cs.luc.edu/~chantin/>`_.

The current director for Information Technology is `Dr. Peter Lars Dordal <https://pld.cs.luc.edu/>`_.

You are expected to confer with your |gpd| about your initial course of study in pursuit of your degree. You should be assigned an advisor for later semesters, to consult about the progression of your academic program.

The GPDs are also available for further discussion of your progress in the program and your plans.
