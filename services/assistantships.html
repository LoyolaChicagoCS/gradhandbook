<h1>Teaching Assistantships<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-assistantships" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Each year the Computer Science department offers a small number of graduate assistantships for new and continuing students. Assistantships are competitive and target students with an exceptional interpersonal and computing background, regardless of which degree you are pursuing.</p>
<p>For a full teaching-assistantship for a full academic year, there are duties for 19 hours per week in the Fall and Spring semesters in computer labs, in support of faculty teaching or research projects, or in-network or web support in the department.</p>
<p>The most recent awards included $18,000 in stipend. Full-time tuition in Fall and Spring plus medical insurance are also included in a full award.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>New merit awards are not given for Summer semesters.</p>
</div>
<p>Research assistantships in Computer Science may also be available from time to time depending upon the availability of faculty research grants. Other units of the university sometimes offer TA awards for Computer Science students.</p>
<p>There is no separate application for seeking research assistantship or TA awards in other units of the university. All applications are initially reviewed by the <a class="reference external" href="mailto:gpd&#37;&#52;&#48;cs&#46;luc&#46;edu">Graduate Program Director</a>.</p>
<section id="new-student-assistantships">
<h2>New Student Assistantships<a class="headerlink" href="#new-student-assistantships" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>New applicants to the Master’s programs in Computer Science should get an email from the <a class="reference external" href="mailto:gpd&#37;&#52;&#48;cs&#46;luc&#46;edu">Graduate Program Director</a>.</p>
<p>Have your application complete by the <strong>deadline</strong> date of:
<em>February 15</em> for <strong>Fall</strong> admission and
<em>September 15</em> for <strong>Spring</strong> admission</p>
<p>The aim is to announce the awards before March 1 for Fall semesters, and in October for Spring semesters.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you miss these deadlines you may apply in your first semester or later as a <em>current</em> student.</p>
</div>
<p>In your application, make sure that you:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Have an <em>email address that you check regularly</em>, or update your current email address with the <a class="reference external" href="mailto:gpd&#37;&#52;&#48;cs&#46;luc&#46;edu">Graduate Program Director</a></p></li>
<li><p>Have excellent undergraduate performance, including all MS prerequisites</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For new students who receive an assistantship, it is customary for the department to commit to the end of the academic year, with an understanding to continue for up to a total of three semesters if funds are available for the next academic year, and if the students maintain their academic and work standards.</p>
<section id="current-student-requirements-and-deadlines">
<h3>Current Student Requirements and Deadlines<a class="headerlink" href="#current-student-requirements-and-deadlines" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Continuing students’ recent academic experience at Loyola is the most important consideration in giving a new award.</p>
<p>Continuing students will get an emailed reminder to their Loyola address several weeks before the deadline.</p>
<p>The reminder will include the URL for an online form to fill out as your application.</p>
<p>The deadlines are <em>earlier</em> than for just admitted students:</p>
<p>Continuing students fill out the online form by
<em>February 15</em> for <strong>Fall</strong> admission and
<em>September 15</em> for <strong>Spring</strong> admission</p>
<p>Students who have already been given an award for the upcoming semester should not fill out the form. Initial awards for current students are generally finalized after the awards to new students are completed.</p>

<section id="possible-english-exam-given-by-loyola">
<h3>Possible English Exam Given By Loyola<a class="headerlink" href="#possible-english-exam-given-by-loyola" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Awardees who did not grow up in the US may be required by the Graduate School to take an extra English test on campus, even if they have other English language certifications.</p>
<p>The standards for TA’s are higher than the entrance requirements. Someone who did not score high enough on the Loyola test will be required to take ESL in the first semester after the exam, and pay the extra tuition.</p>
<p>The cost has generally been about the same as one regular graduate academic credit. The need to actually take the ESL course has rarely happened with students we made a TA, but it is important to note it as a possibility.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>TA tuition awards may not be used to cover the cost of the exam.</p>
